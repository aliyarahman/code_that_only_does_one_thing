Hello all,

I have created a Google Doc to frame the total project, not just the
technical layers (like the commotion software).

Find it here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K-jevvf1ZIrXHJmGvaeKce9eYrFkWe8Ay3LMMavdsHM/edit?hl=en&authkey=CNWLluIIand
request me for editing privileges.

These are just the initial questions I came up with; please ask more, edit
those which have been asked, and answer outstanding questions.

Cheers,

Preston

Is there any good reason not to put this on the commotion wiki at
tech.chambana.net instead?

This looks awesome, thanks for putting this together.  I especially like
the "Identify the practices for" with the 6 types of deployment
situations and the questions around determining how to establish the
project layers.

FYI, it looks like you've set it to be public rather than a request for
editing privileges.

Hello all,

I transferred the Google Doc into the project wiki, at this page:
http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Project_Definition_Discussion__Questions

<http://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Project_Definition_Discussion__Questions>I
will delete the Google Doc, so all discussion can be centralized on the
wiki.

Preston,

This is a great start! As this gets fleshed out a bit, and answers for this
start getting filled in I think there would be a good bit of info that could
be gleaned from here into nice wiki documents.

Im going to start filling in answers inline following a pattern that
hopefully others will follow too, so we can both discuss and converge on
answers simultaneously :)

Regards,
Erich

Hi everyone,

My name is Merouan, I am a PhD student in Political Science at McGill
University - Montr?al. I also heard about commotion through the french
website lemonde.fr and I immediately fell in love with the project!!

I am currently doing my research on the concept of "informational cascades"
or why random instances of street protest spiral in some cases and not
others (for instance, I am trying to understand why would the
self-immolation of a street vendor trigger massive protests in Tunisia and
not elsewhere in the Arab world). Nothing tech related as you can see but I
do speak/write Arabic and French fluently and would be very very happy to
help with translations or anything else if need be.

Again, I would like to congratulate all those working on the project. Coming
from the Arab world, I can only testify on the importance of a free (and
secure) access to the internet for the defence of individual freedoms.

Cheers!

Merouan

Hi folks,

Due to some long-standing issues with gitweb, we're switching to git
daemon to make the Commotion source publicly available. To clone the
Commotion repository anonymously, a user can now say:

$ git clone git://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt

We'll publicize repos for other platforms via git daemon, as well. The
websites will be updated soon.

The gitweb web-based source browser will still be available at:

http://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt

Hi there,

better late than never!
I also discovered Commotion via Le Monde's article (so this is almost a
french speaker thread! ;), and currently working in the non-profit/human
rights sector, I was obviously thrilled.
I am Technical Project Manager though not a dev myself, and as such tend to
think more of the gap between developers and users/potential stakeholders. I
believe it would be great to get more plain language documentation (as
accessible say, as the so-successful-LeMonde-article) to promote the concept
and the progress of the project to potential community/institutional users.
Because the people who will use it are ultimately not devs, but say
emergency field workers and Human Rights Defenders (HRDs)! This in turn
might totally influence your roadmap (and if you have some vague idea to
service the 'third sector', then better develop something fits their need).

I have seen this wiki entry which is a great start I think
https://tech.chambana.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Newbie_How_it_Works
but as a non-dev there are still a few things I am struggling to understand:

1)  what are the USPs (Unique Selling Points) of this project compared to
other open source wireless mesh networks initiatives already used (like OLPC
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO-1#Wireless_mesh_networking. Oh actually
just reading that "Although one goal of the laptop is that all of its
software be open source <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>, the
source code for this routing protocol is currently closed source" booh!). I
understand one is the integration with TOR, but any others?

2) how is the access to the internet addressed, and bandwidth in particular
(access to a wider network for HRDs for example is strategically crucial).
It would be good to have a non-tech version of why/how 100s can access the
internet through the one point/computer and what kind of speed they can
expect.

3) Commotion routers and their role, and access from say deep Rural Northern
Uganda.

Ok, that's a lot to address, but hopefully there will be a few people out
there who are able to answer! I'd suggest best done via the wiki, and then
send us a link,
thanks!

PS: wasn't chambana down yesterday?

I'm behind some pretty sketchy wifi in Detroit right now, which may be the
cause, but I've so far been unable to check out the repo...

bash#~/commotion$ git clone git://git.chambana.net/commotion-openwrt
Initialized empty Git repository in
/blah/blah/blah/commotion/commotion-openwrt/.git/
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

Anyone else having the same problem?

Hi Ben,

We recently pushed a bunch of updates to the development site, and 
that's resulted in a few issues with the repository handling. Brian's 
working on it and should have it fixed in a bit.

Yeah, this was pretty recent. It was fixed, and then while we were 
trying to fix some other stuff and push general upgrades it broke again 
today. So it'll be working again soon. I'm also nearly finished setting 
up a completely new server that will be a lot more reliable and 
up-to-date.

Hi all,

Apologies for the confusion. Apparently, git-daemon had been working 
until we upgraded to gitolite as our access control method. gitolite 
decided it should have complete control over whether something was 
served via git-daemon, so nothing is currently available publicly. I 
should have it resolved in a few minutes.

Thanks,
Brian

Strange. I got the same error as Ben on commotion-openwrt, but I was
able to check out commotion.

Greetings!

I was excited to learn about the project also through the LeMonde article!
What caught me was the link to Indymedia. I have volunteered with Indymedia
since 2000. I am now a graduate student in Seattle writing my thesis on a
project I worked on setting up an IMC in Palestine which though did not
ultimately succeed is giving me a lot of information to look at digital
media in the Arab world, specifically Palestine and Jordan. I am an
Arab-American and I travel between France, the Middle East and the US
frequently for work and research. I would love to put in some time towards
making this project succeed.

Welcome aboard!

We have a lot of ways to get involved. Everything from software
development and testing to documentation, usability, and outreach. What
kind of work do you enjoy doing?

Looking forward to hearing your input on the project.

Not only has he had the opportunity to test all the ideas presented,
they are part of the network he and his fellow volunteers will deploy
at SCaLE 11x, http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale11x for the third
time.

Did you notice he (sort of) offered the equipment and their expertise
to others since they only use the equipment once a year?

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Some pre-experimentation mesh hardware inquiries
Message-ID: <290685eeac0c3bbee7bffeecce1aa956@hethane.se>

Hello,
I'm involved in Ume? Hackerspace, northern Sweden, and we're thinking 
(like so many others) that a wireless mesh network would be great to 
have in our neighbourhood. I've been looking at both Commotion and the 
Byzantium project (http://project-byzantium.org/) for inspiration, 
technology and software.

 From what I can tell Commotion currently has OpenWRT builds for some of 
the Ubiquiti hardware and from what I can tell from documentation this 
is a working solution albeit somewhat hacky and developer-oriented. I 
have a little bit of personal budget to kickstart this project and buy 
hardware to experiment with. My first test scenario is to at least have 
three APs/laptops working in a mesh to connect an apartment a couple of 
blocks away from the source internet connection.

Any experience-based suggestions on which hardware is best suited, 
general tips for putting up a network like this etc. for someone who's 
only used two OpenWRT boxes to "bridge" before?

And a bonus inquiry: are there any efforts (or ideas on how much effort 
it would mean) to put Commotion firmware onto common units like the 
Linksys WRT54GL and such?

Hello!

We tend to focus on Ubiquiti routers for convenience. We have a lot of
them for our own networks because they're reliable and hard to brick.
Commotion should theoretically run on any OpenWRT-compatible hardware
(http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start). The biggest problem we've run into
is that some of the smaller routers don't have enough storage for all
the Commotion packages. I believe there's a minimal Commotion
configuration somewhere in the developer archives. I will see if I can
find it.

The setup you describe sounds pretty straightforward. The routers should
just mesh, and there are a couple of ways to add a laptop/fileserver.
You could run the x86 live image, which will turn the laptop into a very
powerful openwrt node, or you could connect the laptop and router via
ethernet cable. Depending on your OS, this might be a good opportunity
to test the new Linux or OS X clients. They're still very rough, but
they might fit in a test network.

We are in the process of packaging and testing a new Commotion release,
which will add a lot of user interface improvements, as well as some
security features.

Finally, you can find all of our source code, including packages that
haven't been added to the official release, on our github account
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute).

Keep us posted on your progress.

-andrew

Is it possible to configure olsrd on openwrt on something cheap like
TP-Link TL-MR3020 to join a commotion mesh?

That one might be close. It looks like it's supported by OpenWRT under
the ar71xx target we've had good luck with. The limiting factor will be
onboard storage. The Commotion PR3 release is 4.1 MB, and it looks like
the TL-MR3020 only has 4 available.

I don't have any current versions of the 'minimal' ath5k-based Commotion
images, besides those listed below:

http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/bin/atheros-ar2315-minimal/
Circa OpenWRT r31693, from Summer last year

http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/bin/atheros-ar2315-minimal/
Like above, but with a newer kernel and compat-wireless library backported

All of these imageshould have the root pwd pre-set to r0ot56c0MM0t10N .

The only image I tested successfully were the older of the two version
listed above, on a FONera 2100.  Still, I have posted the config file I
used to build both versions, so that you can try building your own.

http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt/openwrt/atheros-ar2315.minimal.config
http://info.gowasabi.net/commotion-openwrt-new/openwrt/atheros-ar2315.minimal.config

Please note the ath5k (aka atheros) images will not run on a WRT54G
(brcm47xx-based) or on the TP-Link (ath9k-based).

It should be straightforward (although tedious) to prune down the current
package set for DR1 Commotion to get a ~4MB sized image in squashfs.
Although, you would likely have to axe potentially useful features, e.g.
IPV6 support or Luci web UI.

Also, do be mindful of the RAM limitation for older devices like a WRT54G,
which has only 16MB of memory.  The recent incorporation of the zram
package into OpenWRT trunk may allow operation on such RAM-bound devices,
but to date I have *not* been able to run the v3.x kernel reliably on these
units.  And the OpenWRT dev team also doesn't expect it to, unfortunately.

Yes, and even the Fonera 2100 still has 8MB of flash. The image would 
actually have to pruned down to something significantly less than 4MB 
in order to accomodate the JFFS2 partition in additon to the squashfs 
one. So we're actually looking at something closer to 2-3MB. We'll see 
how small we can get it, and having so much more of it as C binaries 
should hopefully make it more compact, but my feeling is that it will 
probably turn out that 4MB of flash is just too small to be able to 
support. Anyway, we'll see how it turns out once we have AA-based 
testing images.

This is exactly the approach Open Mesh has taken with their proprietary NG
firmware, i.e. a closed-source daemon to do all the mesh/dashboard
housekeeping stuff.  The NG images hardly weigh in at 2MB now.

I've taken several stabs at trying to prune down previous iterations of
Commotion (i.e. pre DR1) to 4MB, while retaining the luci web UI, by having
the luci sources compressed or pre-compiled, by removing IPv6 support, and
by lots of other little snips and cuts to extraneous packages, but so far
no luck.

Both luci and openssl support seem to guarantee the images will be larger
than 4MB.  If you are to the point of writing a daemon in C, it may also
become worthwhile to either incorporate a very basic HTTP server into that
daemon (which is what coovachilli does) or incorporate bindings to uhttpd.
Probably the latter could be done with reasonable effort.

I'm reluctant to incorporate an http server into the daemon directly; 
seems to be adding a lot of complexity for not much benefit. I'm not 
sure what you mean by uhttpd bindings, if by that you mean some 
mechanism that will further reduce the size. I am currently working on 
ubus bindings, through which the daemon could potentially communicate 
with uhttpd.

From looking at Fabfi's page:

https://code.google.com/p/fabfi/wiki/FabfiNodes

It looks like their firmware only runs on ar71xx atheros platforms, and 
all the devices they have listed have 8MB of flash. So it's likely that 
they run into the same size problems as us.

Hi Josh,

Sorry for being unclear.  By 'uhttpd binding' I had mean using uhttpd as
the ultra-small HTTP server that it is, to respond to requests sent to
ports 80 and 443, but have commotiond serve a collection of HTML forms for
the mesh admin UI.

Indeed, since the OpenWRT build process already offers the option to
pre-compile luci/lua scripts into bytecode for reduced flash and CPU load,
I'm curious if more dramatic pre-compiling / stripping of luci could be
possible to produce to *just* the bare essentials needed for commotiond,
and possibly *less* than what OpenWRT considers a minimal luci
installation.  See below for reference:
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials#minimalistic.offline.installation
http://trac.fonosfera.org/fon-ng/wiki/lua

Furthermore, I'm still assuming zram will also be handy to optimize RAM
usage on 16MB memory devices.  (Maybe 32MB devices too?)

If these methods are effective in pruning down the image size, a neat goal
would be to retain openssl support for tunnelling, etc.  A recent update to
trunk and AA now offloads some of the SSL computation to hardware on ath9k
24kc platform.
https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/33531/trunk/package/openssl

Independent of all this, Fabfi looks pretty cool:

My first question was more about what it takes today to be an (perhaps
unequal) member of a commotion based mesh. It is (still?) olsrd? Any
special parameters?

I'd love to play a little more with it and it would ease the setup to
know more about the basics - I happen to run a few meshes (most based on
batman_adv) and do believe in the solution to end users that commotion
could bring.

(Apologies for being too lazy/time constrained to read the code)

In our upcoming release, we use the Serval daemon as a core technology
of Commotion. In fact, due to a plugin we wrote to integrate Serval's
crypto functions to sign olsrd traffic with a shared key, mesh nodes
that lack this functionality and key cannot mesh with Commotion nodes
that do have it.

So I guess it comes down to what you mean by being a member of a
Commotion mesh. If that just means routing traffic, you could get by
with just servald and olsrd (with requisite plugins). But Commotion has
a whole bunch of other features that you wouldn't get with this setup.

If you can give us a greater idea of what functionality you want or
need, we could probably be more specific. Do you have the ability to get
hardware, or are you just able to use common units like the WRT54G? I
would recommend getting Ubiquiti nodes if you can; their picostation is
around $80USD. We are also working on developing Commotion clients of
Linux/Mac/Windows, which should be available in the near future, in case
you want to run Commotion on a laptop.

Hi all,

We've complied the bare beginnings of a troubleshooting guide intended for
people who deploy and use Commotion networks:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/troubleshoot/wiki/Wiki

As you and those in your network encounter issues or questions, please add
them to the troubleshooting guide. The guide is intended to be useful from
a normal user's perspective ("I can see the AP, but can't connect.") but in
such a way that a network administrator could help diagnose and solve
problems.

Cheers,

Preston

Awesome! Thanks, Preston.

From a developer's perspective, it would be helpful for admins to be
able to check the feature revisions that were used to build their
commotion image. That would give developers an easy way to check for
known bugfixes.

That's further upstream than you asked for, but it would be pretty
straightforward to implement and could even be added to the existing
debug tool.

Does the downloadable commotion software work for both?

Do you have any suggestion about a minimal hardware configuration to test commotion basic software capabilities for mesh networks?



Thanks

Hi Luigi,

Yes, both Nanostation models should work with Commotion. For a minimal 
hardware, I would suggest the picostation. It's what we do our primary 
development on, and is relatively cheap. Let me know if you have any 
other questions!

Hi Dan.
I have followed your suggestion.
I'll keep you informed about the results.

NOTE:
BUT the picsotationM2-HP  cost to me 110$ (shipment included).
I live in Italy.
Because I'm thinking to buy more(bullet,nanostation..) in the near future, I 
want to be sure that my italian supplier is right.
Otherwise can you suggest a cheaper channel?

Thanks .

luigi

This sounds great! The paper clip "dancing lights" state (as Jonathan
describes it) was always the most challenging from a dexterity perspective.

If anyone has opportunities to confirm this, please share here on the
commotion-discuss list!

Some searching thru the UBNT user forums indicates that while it may work
to flash OpenWRT onto their radios via the stock AirOS firmware, it's not
tested and may not work depending on what version of AirOS is there.

Also, which image was flashed via AirOS?  Was it the 'factory' version or
the 'sysupgrade' version?

AirOS would only take the factory version, not the sysupgrade image. 
Also, I tested AirOS version 5.3.5 and 5.5.4 (the oldest and newest 
versions listed on their website); both worked on the Picostation M2. I 
haven't tested with versions 5.5, 5.5.2, 5.5.3.

Message-ID: <CAG3K5U8-3q4o79wObdbOTuBk2NKB=MmY2snwZXDxx9yUSGE9XQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

We've been discussing a bit about how to re-organize the Commotion Wireless
site to incorporate some materials we've been working on as well as make
the site a bit easier to use as a resource for people.

I've posted a suggested Information Architecture on the wiki here:
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/CommotionWirelessIAProposal

I'd love some thoughts and feedback on it. Please reply here with feedback
or add comments on the wiki page!

The Free Network Foundation ( http://www.thefnf.org/) recently went 
through a major relaunch of our website. We found that keeping things 
"shallow" (no deep/multilevel link trees) helped immensely. 
Subscriptions to the mailing list, chili account creation, requests for 
information, volunteer offers etc went way up.

Full disclosure: I am the CTO and cofounder of the FNF, and participated 
heavily in the redesign/relaunch.

We modeled our site after http://onlab.us/

Message-ID: <1DEF8E9109974B8D88A6E93291101930@smallbusiness.local>

Hi Dan,
I did the first experiment with a new Picostation.
I flashed  Commotion firmware following the  guidelines available on the Commotion blog .Easy.
I have set thePicostation as acces point ,just to start.
The difficulty arises when I go through the Commotion sofware administartion interface.
Is there any user manual ?.Also draft.
Very difficult for me to proceed without guidelines and a general vison of what can be done to set a meshed network with Commotion software.
I could  ,but I wouldn?t  like to spend too much time on this if there is already something available .
Thanks.

Luigi

Hi Luigi,

Yes, both Nanostation models should work with Commotion. For a minimal
hardware, I would suggest the picostation. It's what we do our primary
development on, and is relatively cheap. Let me know if you have any
other questions!

Dan

Hi Luigi,

We are working on producing documentation for the newest Commotion 
release, but don't yet have anything to supplant the somewhat 
out-of-date documentation at 
https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki.

If you are using our newest unstable release (DR1), there is a Quick 
Start wizard to guide you through the process of configuring your 
device, when you first flash it. Did you try that?

Dan

Also if anyone would like to share their "where were you when you first
learned the era of Commotion paperclips was over," that would be a good

Or possibly use the opportunity to print some Kickin' It Old School
t-shirts, similar to this one.  But with Cookie Monster holding a paperclip.

I have bought a new Picostation from stock(the second one).

Please let me know how do you want me to proceed in such a way the test 
could be significant for your purposes.
I would use the AirOs web interface.
Please let me know how you proceeded to flash the Commotion.
I'll follow the same procedure.

Thanks.

Luigi

Or possibly use the opportunity to print some Kickin' It Old School
t-shirts, similar to this one.  But with Cookie Monster holding a paperclip.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion Wireless Site IA Proposal
Message-ID: <628E887F697A4B4381AF0535EC998B48@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm an intern applicant through OPW. I spent some time this weekend looking through the site and trying to get a feel for what's available and what gets the most use. 

I don't currently have permissions to edit the Wiki to leave comments there, so I copy/pasted the IA proposal and made comments via Google Drive. Anyone can access the comments with the following link:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_ezmXbtUAyH8gTSlALf1hbbZnedXFBzm-1n0vxAF-U/edit?usp=sharing

I was most unsure about how to organize the Developer's section, and it also varied the most from iteration to iteration, so opinions are welcome there. I tried to take into consideration the feedback on using shallow navigation as much as possible.

Nice to meet you all,
Megan

Hey Luigi,

If you would be willing to download the picostation (bullet factory)
firmware from the site and let us know how difficult/easy it is
installing it using the AirOS interface it would really be appreciated.

Here is the documentation for AirOS firmware upgrades.
http://wiki.ubnt.com/How_To_Upgrade_Your_Firmware

If you encounter anything odd, or have any comments about the process of
finding the firmware or flashing it on the router let us know.

Thanks!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Feedback on the proposed information

Message-ID: <CAF+eoTMtVc6qXsqvs84neP+1NxfuKB0rh0TUQ+JqraCtRSwnYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I am applying for the Gnome OPW internship was advised to provide some
feedback on the proposed information architecture.  I've been taking a look
at the current website, and am finding that a lot of pages are incomplete
or missing information. I was wondering if there is an older website where
that information already exists or if it will be created along with the new
website. I am also feeling unsure what the core purpose of the website is -
whether it is to inform people of commotion wireless' mission, to encourage
developers to work on the project, or if it is meant to direct users on the
installation and use of OpenWRT. For the less tech-savvy user, it might be
helpful to have a quick link on the homepage to setup instructions so that
they don't get overwhelmed with information they don't understand.

Any answers to my questions could help me have a better understanding of
where this project has been and where it is going.

Thanks,

-Emma Barker

The code.commotionwireless.net site hosts a wiki where much information
exists. Other than that, we are just starting to build up an information
architecture that reflects the software where it is now. Before we were
mostly a custom openWRT build. Whereas, we are now actually a more
complex and multi-platform project.

The website is two fold, though not the best at either right now. It's
first goal is to inform new users on what Commotion is, and to provide
the tools to get them using it. The second purpose is to provide a easy
way for new developers to see how they can help with the project.

I like that idea, that is what the "get started" bubbles on the front
page were supposed to be.

Hi Seamus,
I have followed your procedure using AirOs interface on a second 
Picostation I just bought from stock.
After click"upload" the following message is showed: Upload firmware version 
6.0   openwrt-r36088. Firmware is third party make sure you are familiar 
with recovery procedure".
After I proceeded and the uploaded process was completed.
After few minutes I could open the Commotion interafce and I was able to set 
the Picostation .

I confirm.The procedure works definitely.

Luigi


----------------------------------------------------------------------



Hey Luigi,

If you would be willing to download the picostation (bullet factory)
firmware from the site and let us know how difficult/easy it is
installing it using the AirOS interface it would really be appreciated.

Here is the documentation for AirOS firmware upgrades.
http://wiki.ubnt.com/How_To_Upgrade_Your_Firmware

If you encounter anything odd, or have any comments about the process of
finding the firmware or flashing it on the router let us know.

Thanks!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Consideration for solar-powered urban mesh
 offering Commotion, Tidepools, Internet access
Message-ID: <CADSh-SOY34=efWk8y86GegWr777NkaCeS1v=2P=gDxGAhOxAQA@mail.gmail.com>

I am considering submitting a paper on this topic to the Int'l Summit for
Community Wireless
Networks<http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/content/deadline-extended%E2%80%9430-days-left-submit-proposals>conference,
being held this October in Berlin.  Feel free to respond with
comments, criticisms, and witticisms!

Short TL;DR version: low-cost solar/battery powered wifi mesh to let folks
with smartphones and laptops map out / organize / access resources in their
neighborhood, for semi-casual use during disaster recovery.

Longer version ...

Recent discussion with another St. Louisian pointed toward using the
Tidepools <http://tidepools.co/> application to enable users (accessing
Tidepools via smartphone wifi) to announce and locate resources and
exchange messaging within a neighborhood-wide wifi mesh, say something on
the order of 5 square miles for an initial deployment.

In particular, we were curious whether a *10 or 20-node rooftop mesh
powered entirely by solar/battery*, and with a local Tidepools server
running in that mesh, might make itself handy to folks recently deprived of
electrical power, phone, and other utilities.  Using the mesh could be
further incentivized by also providing limited (~1Mbit/s) Internet access,
to the extent feasible, such that disaster victims could keep up
correspondence via email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Furthermore, some of the
roof nodes could have additional hardware to provide *5Volt cell phone
charging ports* at ground level, powered by excess capacity in the node's
solar/battery package.  Also, we assume this mesh would operate 24/7
anyway, i.e. also during non-emergenies, to better familiarize neighborhood
residents with its presence and let them pre-populate the Tidepools map, if
desired.

What I'm curious about is the feasibility of constructing combined antenna
mast + solar panel assemblies that rest on rooftops, anchored by
cinderblocks, with sufficient rigidity/balast to withstand ~60mph wind w/o
damage or significant misalignment.  And for less than 500$US in materials
per rooftop node.  The wifi hotspots themselves create very little wind
loading, so I think a key detail is doing cheap/secure mounting of the
solar panel.  Likewise, I would expect to site rooftop nodes such that a
20-node mesh could continue to operate if even 30% to 40% of the nodes were
knocked offline (e.g. from localized tornado/microburst damage).

This proposal would leverage heavily off the development recently put into
the Commotion Wireless <https://commotionwireless.net/> firmware and
Tidepools <http://tidepools.co/> software developed by the conference
organizer Open Technology Institute <http://oti.newamerica.net/>, along
with the extreme low-cost outdoor mounting techniques I've been developing
via WasabiNet <http://gowasabi.net/content/your-rooftop>.

Your thoughts?

Finally, below is a quick breakdown I made for building a
solar/battery-powered roof node with less than 500$US of materials.
Considering that the wifi hotspot itself draws less than 20W, further
costing-down is possible.  Specifically, a smaller solar panel and smaller
12VDC/24VDC converter should be doable.

   - Ubiquiti Nanostation Loco M2 (runs on 24VDC) - $50

   http://shop.bizsyscon.com/ubiquiti-nanostation-loco-m2-outdoor-mimo-2x2-802-11g-n/

   - 60W 12V Solar Panel - $120

   http://www.amazon.com/Solar-Panel-Crystalline-Energy-Controller/dp/B005HXFWM6

   - 12VDC/6Amp solar charge controller - $50

   http://www.amazon.com/SunSaver-Charge-Controller-12V-6A/dp/B002MQL6L2/ref=sr_1_11

   - OR Cheaper 12VDC/7Amp solar change controller - $20

   http://www.amazon.com/Sunforce-7-Amp-Charge-Controller/dp/B0006JO0XI/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hi_5

   - 9-12VDC to 24VDC step-up converter - $120
   http://www.dxengineering.com/parts/sxa-06760

   - 12V Golf Cart battery - $20
   http://www.ecomelectronics.com/prodinfo.phtml?id=2102397

   - DIY mounts made from cinderblocks, treated lumber, conduit, misc parts
   - $30
   http://goo.gl/62jYJ
   http://goo.gl/eU53G

   - ~50ft of shielded cat5 cable (from $150 spool of 1000ft) and ~100ft of
   ground wire - $20

Total materials: $410 per rooftop node (or $380 with cheaper charge
controller)

This presumes that smartphones, tablets etc have power. 

That is the main issue. I've not seen any good projects for community charging stations. Though I guess they can be thrown together very easily.

Hi Charles,

My thoughts about the use of smart phones and tablets come from observation
(1<http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/After-Sandy-N-Y-recovering-but-slowly-3998882.php>,
2<http://www.northjersey.com/weather/After_Sandy_Things_improving_but_life_wont_be_back_to_normal_for_awhile.html>,
3<http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/sandy-knocks-out-cable-phone-service-to-1-million-in-new-york.html>)
of recent instances here in the US where a weather-related event caused
widespread power outages, and indeed queues formed at locations that still
had electrical power, of people wanting to recharge handhelds.

Phones and tablets usually have several hours of battery life, far better
than laptops.  Also, in extreme situations where the cell towers are all
out too, one could assume folks would only use their handheld while
connected to wifi, further reducing the power consumption.

As for a community charging station, my friend Dann Green (former St. Louis
resident / all-around geek) built this one recently.  This, however, is
definitely an order of magnitude above what I was considering for the solar
rooftop mesh nodes, which is namely just one or two mini-USB ports supplied
with 5V from the battery.

This things are very popular in Africa, India and Asia, so you could
get off-the-shelf solutions. This is just one which recently popped up
in our conversations:

Hi,
I want to share more info about the test.
I used to "commotion wifi" ESSID.
The host PC (iPhone)was Wifi connected to the Client-WDS picostation.
The Adsl modem was connected to the LAN port of  POE of the second 
AP-WDS Picostation.
The two picostations are installed on two balconies(50 m up from ground) 
of my building .One balcony looking  North, the other one looking  West.
In this way I can distribute internet wirelessy over two areas that are 
located in orthogonal directions down to the street. The distance of the 
2 picostations is about  15 m each other but the RF signal has to go 
through the walls of the apartment and the attenuation is significant.
If I go with my iPhone on the street I can connect the iPhone  to 
Internet at a distance of about 100 m from the base of building on one 
direction and 100 m on the other direction.I have created  two internet 
hot spots  with only 1 Internet access.
The output power of the picostation has been set to 14 dBm because 
italian regulation.This is why the distance is not so significant.
But the configuration is good for testing.

Hi Luigi,

Although I can't speak for Commotion developers at OTI, I think it its
likely they would not be able to support WDS modes very well at all.
Besides the partially-functional modes that you have discovered.

WDS is generally a proprietary extension of 802.11, whereby the flavors of
WDS developed by different manufacturers (e.g. Atheros, Broadcom) do not
inter-operate, probably by design.

http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode#wds.-.wireless.distribution.system
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/broadcomwds
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/recipes/atheroswds

Likewise, I think the sort of STA-AP links that WDS builds will not play
well with either the captive portal or the firewall settings used in
Commotion-OpenWRT.

So, the instance of Commotion you have working here likely would not mesh
with any nodes running Commotion-OpenWRT firmware with canonical
configuration.

For the mode of meshing that Commotion OpenWRT (and commmotion-mesh-applet
under Ubuntu/Debian) depends on, the preferred approach to this topology is
to have the nodes talk to each other over a dedicated ad-hoc VIF (virtual
interface), and then have each node broadcast its public AP as an
additional VIF.  This approach avoids proprietary 802.11 extensions like
WDS, to ensure compatibility with as many wifi clients as possible.

Have you tried flashing the Picostations with the Commotion-OpenWRT images
available here (either stable PR3 or unstable DR1)?  The Picostation M2
radios should run the "bullet" images fine, and it seems they should work
for your 2-node mesh.
https://commotionwireless.net/download

Likewise, and to address your questions about Commotion under
Ubuntu/Debian, here are recent builds of the commotion-mesh-applet GNOME
applet, olsrd daemon, and NetworkManager agent:

Message-ID: <51AF72E8.9070007@fastwebnet.it>

Here the status of my activity to connect a PC Linux laptop to the mesh 
network constituted by 2  Picostation and the laptop itself.
Your suggestion are welcome,here.
In this case I used" commotionwireless.net" BSSID.
I had installed the Linux version using the latest repository available 
on commotion web site:

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion-linux

Following the instruction I was able to add the Commotion-mesh-applet to 
the task bar.
If I try to connect the Linux laptop to 1(one) Picostation no way to do 
that.
BUT if I set the IP of my laptop to manual (static) like:

IP:5.135.151.248 (my computer IP adress)
net mask:255.0.0.0
gateway:0.0.0.0
I was able to connect and I can see the olsrd running when I look at 
debug log file after  I launched the applet.
The problem at the moment is that if I try to ping from the laptop to 
the picostation I get the message "host unreachable" like if no route 
was found to reach the picsotation.
Now,looking at the olsrd group,some one has the same problem and it has 
been proposed to use another picostation or another node in the mesh(to 
have 3 node in the mesh at least).
I'm going to try adding the third node.
Is there any one who has exerienced the same issues?Any suggestion?
Luigi

Thanks Ben for your comments.
Are very useful.
I need some help to go in the right direction to use to software and the 
hardware correctly.
Without a manual it takes to me lot of time to try and try.I didn't 
write the software.
See my email on linux laptop.
I had already tried the new repository  as you are suggesting.
See there my comments.

Ignore commotion-mesh-applet for a moment and just try to connect using
olsr. That will at least tell you whether you're meshing.

Using the settings you used before, run the following:
olsrd -d1 -i wlan0 -f
/etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd/profiles/commotionwireless.net.conf

Substitute your machine's wifi interface for wlan0 if necessary. You
might need to use iwconfig to tweak your bssid (02:CA:FF:EE:BA:BE) and
channel. The -d flag will show debug information, including current
neighbor list.

Incidentally, olsrd is actually called from nm-dispatcher-olsrd
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute/nm-dispatcher-olsrd), so you might
use that to determine how your interface is being configured, then see
if it's breaking down at commotion-mesh-applet.

Unless I'm mistaken, it seems like Luigi is just using a normal mesh
setup, with two router nodes that broadcast access points. So not
technically a WDS, correct?

It sounds like you are having success with the router setup, Luigi,
which is great. Thanks for letting us know of your progress! Can I ask,
out of curiosity, what city you are deploying this in?

cheers,
Dan

Hi Luigi,

Sorry for taking a while to respond. There are two possibilities I can
think of why you might not be able to mesh with your laptop. The first
is that your wireless driver on your laptop simply doesn't support
ad-hoc mode; many do not, including my own laptop. Do you know what
chipset you are using? It would also help to see the output of "lsmod",
to see what drivers are loaded. You might want to also consider using a
USB wifi adapter that is known to do ad-hoc, such as the TL-WN821N:
http://www.tp-link.us/products/details/?model=TL-WN821N

The second idea is that, if you are using DR1 version of
Commotion-OpenWRT, then ad-hoc encryption is turned on by default, but
the nm-mesh-applet software currently does not support encryption. From
the router, can you give the output of "iwinfo wlan0-1 info"? You will
see whether encryption is turned on or not.

Which olsrd package are you running on the Ubuntu machine? I had 
problems with pre-compiled binaries for .deb-systems (due to an 
optimization option Debian adds for gcc compiling).

Can you try building olsrd yourself and see if your Ubuntu node works 
then? (remember that when compiling yourself, usually binaries end up in 
/usr/local instead of /usr)

Dan,Mikael,Andrew thanks for your suggestions.

At the end It was possible to have the meshing between the 2 
Picostations and my Linux laptop.
Everything is working now.
Here the steps I did.

The first action was to verify if my laptop was supporting ad-hoc mode.
a) With "lsmod" I have  verified that the driver iwlwifi was installed.
b)With "lspci -v" I found the chipset of the wireless device:Intel 
Centrino Advanced-N6200.
It easy to find that the ad-hoc mode is supported.Go to 
http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/iwlwifi

c)I have investigated the second possibilty :if the router was 
supporting the encryption and the nm-mesh-applet not.
So I followed the suggestion of Andrew on Commotion-discuss Digest, Vol 
9, Issue 6,and I tried to connect by olsr

olsrd -d1 -i wlan0 -f /etc/nm-dispatcher-olsrd/commotionwireless.net.conf

and checking the encryption setting on the router and on my laptop(using scan).
I found several inconsistencies between the output of  the router  web page  and the laptop setting.And more ..
I don't want to report all the list of inconsistencies.
So I had the suspect that I was using an old release of the software.
I flashed the router with the available release  on April 2013.
For this trial I used the new ...openwrt-ar71xx-generic-ubnt-bullet-m-squashfs-factory.bin posted on 24/5/2013.

With this release everything worked at the first attempt.
So it is up to you,now,to explain the main differences between the current  release and the 1 month old one.

Luigi

ps .To answer to Dan,I live in FANO http://www.fano.it/ and I'm try to involve some people to work on this very interesting project supported by Commotion.

I honestly don't know what could have changed in the router firmware
with a month that would suddenly cause it to work. We've been doing a
lot of bug fixing over the last couple months, that it could have been a
number of things. The 24/5 images on the website now are the stable
images. Did you find out if the ad-hoc network was encrypted, indicated
by iwinfo?

Also, since you'll be much closer than us, you should consider coming to
the International Summit for Community Wireless Networks this October in
Berlin: wirelesssummit.org. The Commotion dev team will be there for sure.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion DR1.1 Release
Message-ID: <51B5EC1E.5060305@chambana.net>

Hi all,

Now that the download page on the main website is updated, I just wanted
to send out the release notes for our latest point release. This should
be the beginning of a more rapid release cycle. You can download DR1.1 at:

https://commotionwireless.net/download

Release notes below:

Commotion DR1.1 Release Notes

Developer Release 1.1 is the first stable release of the DR1 series.
This release is the beginning of our new stable branch, and represents a
significant step forward from our previous stable release.
What is a Commotion release?

Commotion release versions represent a target set of features for the
entire project
(http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Official_Version_Feature_Targets).
Software packages for individual platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) may be
in different stages of development, and are labeled according to their
supported features.
Platform Availability:

Currently, only the OpenWRT-based router firmware is DR1 compatible.
Other platforms are under active development and are being brought up to
feature parity. Current platform revisions can be found on the Official
Version Feature Targets page.
Features:

    Easy-to-use setup wizard: The Commotion Quickstart provides a
simple, one-step interface for setting up a Commotion node.

    Local applications: The Commotion Apps Portal is an interface for
creating and browsing for local network applications.

    Common platform for managing settings: The Commotion Daemon provides
a common management interface for maintaining the configurations of
different community networks.

    Encryption tools: Commotion configures industry-standard IBSS-RSN
encryption by default, and provides the Serval crypto API to aid
developers in creating secure applications.

    Consistent visual style: New Commotion releases are all styled in
accordance with the Commotion Human Interface Guidelines
(http://commotionwireless.net/docs/hig/introduction).

    Simplified debugging: A new Commotion Debugging Helper tool makes it
easy to retrieve useful troubleshooting information from a node in the
event of a network problem.

Fixes:

    Innumerable fixes and changes went into this release since Preview
Release 3 (PR3), the previous stable branch. A complete list can be
found on the Commotion project site.

Megan's
(https://docs.google.com/a/opentechinstitute.org/document/d/1Z_ezmXbtUAyH8gTSlALf1hbbZnedXFBzm-1n0vxAF-U/edit)
had many good points on flattening out the links on this page. Currently
it is very nested. I think that we can collapse many of the sections
together to give more content per click to a user.

I like a variation of the  alternative she proposed with a top header of
(about, use, develop, blog, download, report a bug).

We should add a separate press-kit accessible from the footer so that we
can control teh messaging and content used by press around Commotion.
Our press is one of my biggest headaches, so a repository with quotes,
images, FAQ's, background video, etc would be a great way to control
that message.

I don't know where we landed on how we will support application
development, but we should settle on how much support we can provide for
mesh application development and support before we put a "develop apps"
page on the top bar.

I'm moving this discussion to the commotion-discuss list.

For those just joining in, the issue in question is how to present usage
warnings related to Commotion's current capabilities[1] in a way that
does not imply that the user has misconfigured the software.

On one hand, we need to be very clear about Commotion's current
capabilities, especially given the press around the project. On the
other hand, we don't want to give the impression that a correct
installation has failed somehow.

@Georgia: I think trying some alternative displays of the warning label
on the download page is definitely worth trying. However, I would just
as that you clone the page and send us links to that instead of
modifying the actual download page until we've decided on any changes.

In general, I think it's better to make users feel empowered than
scared. It's already hard enough getting folks to adopt this technology.
If someone is concerned about their security, they will likely take note
of any warning labels they see, even if it isn't quite the center of
attention of the page. I think it's worth considering alterations to the
page to make the warning label lower down and/or somewhat smaller.

I agree.  I would advocate for removing it--it looks like an error-- 
and also doesnt really help the user navigate the risks.  I agree with  
Georgia that Commotion's often inaccurate press requires us to be  
proactive around what it cant do (also most software should), but in  
the end the security is very similar to any router firmware.  In most  
browers the warning takes up most the page, so you cant even see the  
downloads.  I think a link or button that says "Learn more about  
Security with Commotion" would be sufficient, and then it can say, "as  
with most home wireless systems, xxx."

Along these lines of public perception, is Commotion perhaps the only
embedded router firmware out there (compared to DD-WRT, Freifunk, and other
OpenWRT derivatives) that includes such warning language on its download
page?

If so, and if those other firmware distros are likewise capable of doing
90% to 100% of what Commotion does anyway (albeit with more user
configuration effort needed), then I also agree with Ryan.  The warning is
not serving its intended purpose, and intimidating would-be users.

Boilerplate about "no warranty given or implied / no liability for damage"
should likely be adequate.

Probably, but this warning label is a direct result of Commotion's
billing as a circumvention tool, and specifically the representations of
Commotion's capabilities in the press.

We have a lot of features on the roadmap that aren't implemented yet,
some of which would be bad to get wrong.

Commotion has been publicly advertised as a security and circumvention
tool. A warning that can be disregarded, or examines Commotions security
in terms of liability, or from the perspective of it simply as router
firmware disregards the social realities surrounding the tool.

The Commotion warning label is an intervention. It uses global standards
for warning construction that were researched to cause exactly the
reaction we are seeing. This includes placement, size, color, and
language. Because it follows global standards users understand that it
is important and read the contents.

I would argue that it does in fact help a user navigate the risks since
each warning is directly linked to an overview of the risk and tools
that the user can use instead, or on top of commotion, in order to
address risks that they are concerned about.

https://commotionwireless.net/understanding-commotions-warning-label#internet


Wireless risks and security are very rarely understood, let alone mesh
security and risks. With our placement as "circumvention technology" in
the public we have a responsibility to educate any possible user on the
current state of the Commotion platform for circumvention and security.

Camouflaging the warning label below the fold, or in a color scheme that
is not immediately understood as a warning is in my opinion dishonest.
Until public opinion matches the current capabilities and safe use cases
of the Commotion platform I think that this intervention is the only
morally correct option. Safety should always trump style and comfort.

I absolutely hear what you are saying Seamus, and understand the reasoning
and all of the work you have put into the warning label.

Also - I don't think we should make any massive changes without looking at
some data. My initial suggestion was to explore some options, for us to
consider. It would also make sense to look at some data. The handful of
feedback from the hackday, is simply that, a handful. It'd be good to look
at how many people click on the links Seamus is referring to as well as
downloads and how many people land on the page and don't download.

Along the lines of these questions, do we have piwik setup and working? Or
is that still being fixed?

Another aspect to consider for when we are doing trainings is to approach
the downloading of the router image step differently. Especially in the
classroom setting it might make more sense to have the files ready for use
(on USB or local storage), rather than being dependent on access to the
commotion website. One challenge I've noticed when we've done this in Red
Hook (and at hackdays) is that we then put ourselves in a situation where
everyone is downloading the same file at the same time, over somewhat
limited networks the users/trainees and have a generally slow experience.

I vote - let's look at the data, decide the priority of this within the
website overhaul, and think about what it means in the training context.

Agreed. This should be a considered process.

Do you have any ideas on how we can test new versions and track results?

References: <mailman.4709.1370876964.2974.commotion-discuss@lists.chambana.net>

Everything at home which has a wifi interface can be connected and the 
network(built by 2 picostations) is working as ad-hoc network.
   If the fridge,the oven or the stove had a wifi interface, they would 
be connected to commotionwireless.net too.
    The only issue I have found is that if I try to access internet with 
the  linux laptop  using the ad-hoc interface of the AP router,I can't.
    But if I use the router AP as master ,I can.
    I red somewhere that this feature is not avalable for laptop. Please 
confirm.
    On the other end if I connect a local web server to the POE LAN port 
of one router, I can have access to the  web page also from the linux 
laptop through the  ad-hoc  interface     of the router(picostation).
    As a demo to show the capabilities of commotion solution I would 
like to implement a Server application.
    Which application  do you suggest first that can explain better the 
commotion solution capabilities?
    I need to recruit some people on ths project.

     Luigi

     ps.  I 'm pretty sure to be in Berlin on October for ISCWN

When connecting your laptop to the picostation over ad-hoc, do you have
olsrd running on the laptop? If so, and if the picostation has access to
the internet, your laptop should get a route via olsrd to the internet
as well.

To troubleshoot this, try checking the output of "nc localhost 2006" (to
show olsrd info), and "route -n" on the laptop to show local routes.

As for applications, I would suggest either Tidepools (a local mapping
application: http://www.tidepools.co/) or MediaGrid (a secure
file-sharing and webchat application:
https://github.com/danstaples/MediaGrid). They both require a good bit
of tinkering to work well, but could be a fun project. Or you could try
for something simpler to setup, like an Apache web server.

Also, when you have the server set up, try using the application portal
on the picostation
(https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Application_Portal).
When you "add an application", it will show up automatically on other
routers nearby within a few minutes!

Message-ID: <CABmJbFWvn=v_OsTdE+EwZGEP2d3grw26xH5Gac+u-SOVha7abQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Is there any good source of materials to run a workshop about DIY mesh
networks? Software to use, slides to show about the theory of
operation?

I've been approached by guys from Moscow "Strelka" institute [1] about
running a workshop about DIY WiFi mesh networks and I'm looking for a
way to make it happen. Guys are engaged into volunteer crisis response
activities and a general DIY.

1. http://www.strelka.com/?lang=en

I'm trying to find people in Moscow who have real life experience with
WiFi mesh networks, especially DIY ones, but without much result so
far. Unfortunately, mesh networks are not so popular in Russia (yet).
And since I have only theoretical understanding of concepts and no
real experience, I'm looking for an easy way to (1) have something up
and running and (2) find some presentation materials about various
WiFi mesh projects, technology itself, etc.

Hardware wise we have old Fon devices, I should have two MeshPotatos
somewhere and we might be able to get some Ubiquiti gear from a
friendly company. I'm also thinking about simply installing olsrd or
batmand on few laptops as an easy way to get something up and running.

All recommendations and pointers are very appreciated.

Hi Alexander,

We can share with you the workshop materials and format we have used in
Detroit, Brooklyn and Dharamshala.  It might be best to have a quick
chat so we can explain the goals of each of those trainings, the
backgrounds of the participants and the goals...

Let me know when you can chat and I'll pull the training team together.

Best,
Ryan

Ryan,

That would be great!
Tomorrow (Thurs) or the day after (Fri) morning your time / evening my
time would be ideal for me. What is your preferred date/time?

I'm available on IRC, Skype and Hangouts, whichever is easier for you.

Hey all. I had not started work diagnosing it. Now that we have some

you were using was a custom compiled build from Griffin. Correct?

So my theory yesterday was that if there are many requests for the splash

Just my crazy idea.

Hi All,

I can confirm having encountered similar issues specifically repeater nodes
not correctly masq'ing AP traffic to the Internet, while gateway nodes do.
My own problems were encountered running both private APs and coovachilli
APs (as opposed to nodogsplash) on nodes running the WasabiNet firmware,
not Commotion-OpenWRT. However the firewall config is quite similar.

So, on repeater nodes I have the 'masq' option enabled for zones mesh, ap1,
and ap2 (i.e. public and private APs).  On gateway nodes, it seems that I
need to have 'masq' disabled for zones ap1 and ap2.

Hey Bill,

Thanks for subscribing to commotion-discuss. CCing that list in this response.

Some of the messages I got from other implementers and OTIers suggest
that there is a bug in the splash screen for repeater, not gateway,
nodes. The developers are working on isolating it. Any data we can get
from our routers is good for them. I did try to go through the AP,
both with my phone and my laptop, and neither worked. Yet, all the
implementers - including me - can SSH in to their DR1.1 node and from
it ping out to the internet by the command line. So it's a splash
screen problem.

The settings did not carry over, I unchecked the "keep settings"
button - a must-do at this stage since all features aren't static.

I personally know that the two routers on MtP street have DR1.1, and
mine has PR3 - all the others have PR 2.1. The main issue with
updating, other than making sure not to carry settings over, is that
the new versions turn on mesh encryption by default and don't turn on
the wireless interfaces by default when you first start them up. This
doesn't work well with implemented networks in Mount Pleasant, Red
Hook, Detroit, etc. since it's not always easy to get to where you can
connect to the nodes by Ethernet. So, Dan rolled a custom image that
keeps the wireless interfaces on when you update, which I used for
both MtP Street routers.

However since you can easily manage your own node I recommend that if
you want to update, you should do so - just make sure you don't turn
mesh encryption on for your node, since all the nodes in the network
have to have it on for it to work. Otherwise the devices won't mesh.
If you run QuickStart, it will automatically encrypt the mesh links,
so you can either run it and then turn mesh encryption off, or you can
just set up the node yourself through the admin interface.

I believe that the next version of Commotion, DR2, is due out at the
end of next month (correct me if I'm wrong team) - stay tuned and
we'll probably update all the routers with that at that time, and turn
on encryption.

Thanks for staying meshed,

Preston

Thanks for filling me in Preston.   I'll probably wait for DR2.. things
seem to be working smoothly here with the current firmware, and I know
people have been using it more the last couple days due to Comcast issues
on our block, so I don't want to potentially disrupt anyone if we'll be
upgrading in another few months.

Hi All,

I can confirm having encountered similar issues specifically repeater nodes
not correctly masq'ing AP traffic to the Internet, while gateway nodes do.
My own problems were encountered running both private APs and coovachilli
APs (as opposed to nodogsplash) on nodes running the WasabiNet firmware,
not Commotion-OpenWRT. However the firewall config is quite similar.

So, on repeater nodes I have the 'masq' option enabled for zones mesh, ap1,
and ap2 (i.e. public and private APs).  On gateway nodes, it seems that I
need to have 'masq' disabled for zones ap1 and ap2.

It was a pleasure to join Commotion team several  months ago.
With your support I was able to implement a local mesh newtwork with
two routers (picostation), my  two Linux LapTops and Iphone.
I have also tested the capabiity of commotiont application portal by
installing either Tidepools and MediGrid.
Most of the time spent to play with the raspberry and after installing
MediaGrid.
Everything works.I tried to upload and share some music and the chat.

Based on this experience I have some questions.
a)How to make the Raspberry pi part of the Mesh?In my application I have
connected it to the AP as external device.
b)Is there any future for the integration of raspberry in the commotion network?

Last question.
c)My idea is to buy two Nanostations and to extend the range of my local mesh.
Any suggestion based on your experience?
To reach longer distances(1 to 2  miles)I would choose a 5Ghz (the power
limit in Italy is 1 W output power at 5Ghz).Much more less for Wifi(15dbm).
Thanks for your support and suggestions.

Luigi

Hi Luigi,

Glad to hear about all the successes!

I have made a mesh network from Raspberry Pis before (battery-powered,
even), so it's definitely possible. The main challenge is to pick a good
USB wireless adapter. I recommend the TP-Link TL-WN722N [1], since its
driver supports ad-hoc mode in recent Linux kernels.

Then, you install your Raspberry Pi operating system (I recommend
Raspbian), and configure the wireless adapter to be in ad-hoc mode with
the correct SSID,BSSID,channel, etc. This is done in
/etc/network/interfaces...if you need info on how to to that, I can give
you resources.

Then you can install and configure OLSRd on the Pi, so that it can mesh
with the other devices. For an olsrd config file, you can look at
/var/etc/olsrd.conf on one of your picostations for an example.

Let us know how that goes!

-Dan

As for your other questions, we would like to have a Commotion image for
Raspberry Pi, but it is not a top priority for now. Perhaps someone from
the dev community can create one ;)

And we often use Nanostations for connecting parts of a mesh network
over longer distances. They work really well for that purpose, but
aren't the best for providing access points since they are directional.

Hi Dan,
totally agree that main challenge is to pick up a good USB wireless.
I have bought (1 month ago) theTP-Link  TL_WN821N(V.2).The V.2(I found 
out later) is not in the Linux kernel. I had to install the firmware 
carl9170. Easy to make it works in managed mode.
Still not working in ad-hoc mode.Not sure if it is a problem of the 
firmware( it should work also in ad-hoc) or the /etc/network/interfaces  
and wpa_supplicant setting.
Assuming that TL_WN821N(v.2) works,could be helpful to have some info 
from you based on your experience.
After I'll buy the TP-Link TL-WN722N
Thanks.

Hi Luigi,

USB wifi adapter compatibility is tricky for instances where you want the
radio to broadcast multiple SSIDs (i.e. adhoc signal and a local AP
signal).  To date, I've only been able to get this working on
TL-WN821N *v3*which uses the
*ath9k_htc* driver, not v2 which uses the carl9170 driver.  Likewise for
the TL-WN722N.  Even then, I had patch the ath9k_htc driver (patch for
OpenWRT included) to make the radio do multiple SSIDs.

On the other hand, if you are using the commotion-mesh-applet tool under a
compatible desktop GUI like GNOME or Mate, it will only start a single
adhoc interface, rather than multiple SSIDs.  The caveat, at when I last
tested that tool in March, was that it expected the USB wifi interface to
be named "wlan0" rather something else like "wlan1."

Could you respond with the OS and kernel versions on all machines involved,
i.e. your laptop and the rPI?  The USB wifi driver might also be a bit
stale, too.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Really little $20 POE wifi hotspot: AirGateway
Message-ID: <CADSh-SNo2dNgjHFNyd1twezfOkp5Q17oh10nRc-va=T4v7SJjg@mail.gmail.com>

I spied someone showing off their modded Ubiquiti AirGateway on the Burning
Man wifi list, in particular cracked open to run directly off 12VDC from a
solar panel / battery system:

http://mindfart.com/pic/?airgate-injector1
http://mindfart.com/pic/?airgate-injector2

The burners seem to love it, what with all that radical self-reliance and
so forth.

In normal use, this little guy snaps in between the stock POE injector
provided with the UBNT radio and the cat5 run. I believe it has the same
400MHz / mips32 embedded SoC as other UBNT M-series gear, and 32MB of RAM.
My guess is that it has 2dB on-board patch antenna, but I'm hoping that
de-popping 0ohm resistors makes the addition of an RP-SMA pigtail possible.

http://www.ubnt.com/airmax#airgateway

Looks like Ubiquiti is totally sneaking this under the radar.  Vendors
should start selling it hopefully in a month or two, although burners say
it can be purchased right now by creating an account at
reseller.streakwave.com.

The datasheet indicates it runs AirOS, which would suggest reflashing to
OpenWRT is possible.  I've yet to find any confirmation about that, though.

What do you think?

Here's one perspective:

Private industry collusion towards self-serving goals is pretty common
place for the Internet these days.  (Boy, don't I sound jaded.)

The partners thus far disclosed: Facebook, Ericsson, MediaTek, Nokia,
Opera, and Qualcomm, are all content providers or device manufacturers, no
carriers.  This looks similar to the dichotomy observed here in the US in
the "Net Neutrality" debate, where you see traditional phone/cable carriers
like Time Warner, Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast spar with content providers or
device manufacturers like Google and Microsoft.

So, yes indeed, a possible outcome from this partnership could be an
ultra-low-cost Android tablet with heavily optimized versions of Chrome OS
/ Opera / Facebook Home, bundled with very cheap 4G/LTE service, and
finally polished off with a generous helping of spyware.  No doubt such a
device could become the introduction to the Internet for a billion people,
but I can't help but be wary about how mediated that Internet access would
be.

Also, nothing about the partnership suggests any willingness to seriously
engage any Open Source technology, in particular the conspicuous lack of
Canonical's Ubuntu Edge or a successor to the OLPC.

Most unsettling is Qualcomm's participation, since they own all Atheros IP
now.  Almost all of Commotion's success in mesh wifi (and likewise for
OpenWRT / Funkfeuer / Ninux) derives from the existence of the Open Source
ath9k driver.  Has anyone perhaps seen a roadmap PDF from Qualcomm /
Atheros indicating the intended successor to the ath9k chipset?

That is, these guys are getting pretty old:
http://wikidevi.com/wiki/Atheros

I'm curious about Open Source driver prospects for these devices:

Hi Ben - these look pretty interesting. Once they are available I will
probably order one to play with.

Should be a great board for experimentation, or as a low cost indoor AP
for community / neighborhood networks that are mostly rooftop based!

A member of the WISPA listserv informed me these guys actually use a
slightly different chipset than the existing UBNT M-series radios, and that
no sneaking under radar was being attempted.  They're just very cheap
products, so UBNT's willingness to commit lots of resources to marketing
them is likely minimal.  They are more or less on sale now,  and definitely
at the reseller.streakwave.com site.

I should again point out I've still not found any mention yet of folks
flashing these units with OpenWRT.

I am hoping we can test a few builds of OpenWRT on these and find out.
I'm going to leave the actual testing of that to the Commotion
developers though, as I'm not sure how to go about doing that.

Facebook eyes mesh networks to connect users and businesses
A patent application describes a system that would allow for hyper-local
advertising and networking
By Martyn Williams
August 17, 2013 04:24 AM ET

IDG News Service - Facebook has designed a system that would allow
individuals and advertisers to make direct connections to those
physically nearby that share similar interests or are open to receiving
certain advertisements.

The company's work was outlined in a U.S. patent filing for a "wireless
social networking" system that was published this week and represents a
further step towards advertising and communication that is locally
targeted.

What!

I have been using this as my local business pitch (opt in of course) for
over a year... its on facebook. I have to have some original art for
this strewn around on some recorded talk or another. I am going to
destroy that patent!

You mean it *was* on facebook until they realised it might threaten their patent? ;-)

The latter might help actually.

Message-ID: <CADnE-+6gFLUUAm_FdJuTEe5B9f1Y8OfTM83rf_eUik9tO0U3GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

We are working on our "Commotion Construction Kit" materials to help people
set up their own networks. I am currently looking for some examples of node
naming conventions/systems so that a new person to wireless networking can
easily get the idea. Also maybe examples of password creating
conventions/systems, both for Admin and for APs.

If anyone has anything they'd be willing to share, that would be great!
Credit given of course, and we would change any identifying information
that shouldn't be shared out.

Thanks,
Darby

I am currently looking for some examples of node naming conventions/systems so that a new person to wireless networking can easily get the idea. Also maybe examples of password creating conventions/systems, both for Admin and for APs.

Over here, we often abbreviate street names (== the location of the node) and add the housenumber.
So for example, 57 Georgia Ave NW would become: 57gavNW
That's easy enough for people to construct the name in their heads but "crypto" enough so that other people do not automatically know what it means. We also sometimes use node names as ESSIDs and as fully qualified hostnames in DNS. 

Not saying this is the best approach, but it works. People remember the domain names of nodes.

Concerning Password creating schemas: https://xkcd.com/936/
(and might want to add some characters inbetween the spaces). 
Do *not* use anything less than 12 characters. Seriously.
That video from Defcon 2011 pretty much nailed it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFU-BS4ZZMw

pIn Mount Pleasant and Red Hook, hostname and AP naming works like
this: SLUG-Name

In Mount Pleasant, every node starts with MtPCWN and is followed by a
name that the owner / host of the node chooses. So,
MtPCWN-TowerofPower, MtPCWN-1825Ingle, MtPCWN-Paloma.

in Red Hook, they've finally settled on RHWIFI-NAME. With Quickstart,
it has to be a -, not a _, between names. And spaces aren't a great
idea in hostnames.

But there are other options of course! You can also name every node
with the same AP and it will appear as only one SSID.

Today I got updated myself on this topic (thx Ars Technica): http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/08/thereisnofatebutwhatwemake-turbo-charged-cracking-comes-to-long-passwords/

Kind of sucks when you tell people to use really long passwords based on dictionary words. They might really just use a quote from their favorite book (H.P. Lovecraft or bible, each to one's liking) and end up with in fact weak passwords.

So, I still stand by my "and add some (random) characters between the spaces of words" but better to use something stronger.

GPU cracking is making is just too easy...
Just imagine what a botnet of GPUs can do.

Sorry, had to correct my previous post.

In Columbia Heights we experimented with different naming conventions,
ultimately settling on CommuntityWireless so that it it was obvious what
it was and so that you could seamlessly walk between nodes.

>From there, we allowed node hosts to customize the text and layout of
their splash pages, so they could differentiate themselves that way.

Also, do NOT use spaces, as (at least with PR3) this caused seriously
problems and the node would have to be reset through direct connection
and not wirelessly. Which is frustrating for already deployed nodes.

Thanks Aaron forthe update. What do yall do to keep track of passwords, and
which nodes the pertain to? Any words of advice for someone new to
community networks on that?

Thanks Grady. Just to clarify, every node has the same name,
CommunityWireless, is that correct?

On the topic of splash pages, we should get some examples of those for
people to see, as well.

I am pretty sure the quick start doesn't let you use invalid characters 
for hostnames or SSIDs now.

And for passwords, I use KeePass (http://keepass.info) for password 
management, but I have no idea how to manage passwords that are 
supposed to be shared among a group...that's a tough question.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] HTC desire Android 2.3.3 rooted and setting in
	ad-hoc mode
Message-ID: <5220C501.4080500@fastwebnet.it>

I have bought an old HTC Desire,just for fun.
The purpose is to connect it on the commotion mesh network.
I have already installed the lates Mesh Tether version  that I have 
downloaded form the commotion web site.
After few trials  I have  realized that the phone cannot see other near 
nodes in adhoc mode.
The reason is,as explained in the commotion web site,that the ad-hoc 
mode is not set and to this, the phone has to be rooted before.
Now.
Before to go through Google is there any one that can send some 
guidelines on how to root the phone and activate the ad-hoc mode.I need 
some guidelines not the details.
I prefer to get some help form people that already did it before.
Thanks.

Here's a quick resource on rooting: 
http://lifehacker.com/5789397/the-always-up+to+date-guide-to-rooting-any-android-phone

Perhaps Will Hawkins can reply, but I believe the new version of 
Commotion-Android he's working on doesn't require root access anymore.

Message-ID: <2ABB993B-CEE6-46AC-BC82-4480B737209C@gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I apologize if I have overlooked the firmware somewhere. But, I stumbled upon commotion and really want to try it out. I have 4 picostation2 hp's and would like to try out commotion before purchasing the new picostations.  I am on a volunteer fire department and we want to try and set up something at our firehouse and neighborhood. 
Does anyone have a picostation 2 HP firmware?
I tried compiling one myself but the picostation won't accept it. 

Thanks in advance. 

Thanks,

Frank

Message-ID: <CAKxU6K38CaiDJ5GLsFYAE4sCqyCkbggDirT_yK0-HBnZc75qLg@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Commotion Community,

I?ve been having problems with one of my nodes labeled Computer-Lab. I do
not think I experienced these problems until I upgraded to DR2. The
computer-lab is configured to mesh through Ethernet but also has meshed
with the outdoor node training-center.

During the last few days during class while students were using the network
I tried to download a file from the FP server.  Download speeds where very
high but halfway through during the download the computer-lab node
disconnected every students computer and lost the signal from the
computer-lab.  About 20 seconds later we were able to re-connect to the
computer-lab again.  The same thing also happened when I tried downloading
a file from the internet as well at another separate time.  I've also heard
from students that they have experienced the same problem with some of the
other nodes where all of the signal suddenly dropped and then returned 30
seconds later.

Also, this morning when I tried to connect to the Internet in the computer
lab I did not receive the splash screen or connect to the net even though
once I logged into the router could see that I was successfully meshed and
could ping the default gateway from the router without an issue.

The same problem happened two days ago with my central-tower node.

I know that near one of the nodes we have a cable TV coming into the school
via an antennae which may operate on a similar frequency because the
students cannot watch TV when the node that is closest to the antenna is
plugged in.  However, the antenna for the TV is not always plugged in so
when I had the other issues with the signal dropping during the day the TV
definitely did not have power.


Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Hi Dan,

Are you able to see if the router is rebooting during those periods 
when it drops connections? The top LED would be blinking. We've been 
seeing some DR2 reboot problems here with the network we set up for a 
conference. We disabled and turned off Serval on the nodes, and that 
has so far fixed the reboot problem...but it also prevents app 
advertisement from working. So we're going to try to find a fix for 
this as soon as possible.

I'm not sure about the problem where you can't connect to the internet 
or get the splash page. Maybe could you give us the debug output the 
next time that happens? It's under the Commotion menu from the web 
admin interface.

I'm pretty sure the top LED light was blinking.  How can I disable
Serval? I would like to see if that solution works over here.

Well, this does certainly answer a rather burning question I've had about
scattering small rooftop antenna rigs on other people's rooftops around
town.  Thank you.

Ben, could speak to any expectations you've encountered from your insurance
carrier about antenna mounting equipment that can be used?  That is, has
your carrier indicated whether they tend to prefer clients only using
off-the-shelf tripods, brackets, lightning grounding units, etc, or if
they've shown some tolerance for DIY gear?

Cheers!

Message-ID: <CAKxU6K3=jZG5sOLevGzTSJjzA5bBhPviczWM9XL3rum2vnh5uA@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy Commotion Community,

I hope those of you in Berlin are all having a good time at IS4CWN. Wish I
could join you.  Before I got into detail about my issue, I want to say we
have 4 nodes meshed now and have a very strong Student Network thanks to
Commotion. See image below:

[image: Inline image 1]

The screens shot is taken from the Computer-Lab node which also acts as a
gateway. Even though not labeled the central-tower acts as a gateway as
well.

As for my main concern, I?m having problems my Computer-Lab node. I do not
think I experienced these problems until I upgraded to DR2. The
computer-lab is configured to mesh through Ethernet but also has meshed
with the outdoor node training-center.

During the last few days during class while students were using the network
I tried to download a file from the ftp server.  Download speeds where very
high but halfway through during the download the computer-lab node
disconnected every students computer and mine from the computer-lab.  About
20 seconds later we were able to re-connect to the computer-lab again.  The
same thing also happened when I tried downloading a file from the internet
as well at another separate time.

Also, this morning when I tried to connect to the internet in the computer
lab I did not receive the splash screen or connect to the net even though
once I logged into the router could see that I was successfully meshed and
could ping the default gateway from the router without an issue.

The same problem happened two days ago with my central-tower node.

The router that the central-tower and computer-lab are connected to that
acts as a gateway is using DD-WRT, would this cause any issues?  Also the
computer lab and the training center nodes and girls-dorms nodes are all on
the same subnet of 101.108.214.1/24 This shouldn't cause a problem should
it? If it does how can I change AP's network?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Strange Splash Page Behavior
Message-ID: <525D6CDA.2010708@abaarsotech.org>

I just set up our second commotion network at school for the teachers. I
put the network on a different channel (7) and added WPA2-PSK
encryption.  The first odd thing I noticed was when using the
unencrypted student network I picked up the wrong DNS servers.

I also noticed that I could connect to the student network and receive a
really good signal from my room. Normally I could not even connect to
the student network from this location.  It seemed like the two networks
were intertwined but when I checked the OLSR page they are definitely
not connected. I'm not sure if this is an issue I have with my router or
with my commotion nodes.

I'm using the latest overnight build on the teacher encrypted network
and just the DR2 stable release on the student network.

Thanks for the the help.

Hi Dan,

Can you give a little more detail about the DNS issue? What was it set
to, and how did you find out? Usually one's computer will set its DNS
server to the one(s) specified by the router, which is sent in the DHCP
response. So unless you manually configured the DNS servers your
computer uses, it should be using the router itself as the DNS server.

And what was the strange splash page behavior you experienced?

Hey Dan,

Must have erased the section about the splash page. Sorry about that. I
could not get the splash page to disappear on the password protected
network and it would not appear on the open student network. Fixed the
issue by checking the immediately authenticate box on the closed network. I
first tried the allowed hosts/subnets and could not get it to work but the
immediately authenticate option works fine. Everything is back to normal
now but I'll let you know if it happens again.  As for the DNS issue. I
think it may have been a problem with one of my local DNS servers. I set
each node to use the local server rather than the open DNS servers that I
normally use and it did not seem to work. I'll have to check my
configuration on my local servers.  Everything seems to be ok for now.
Sorry for the clarification error. Thanks for the help.

Dan

Thanks for the update. For the splash page issue you were seeing, that's
a known bug (and I'll file a bug report right now). Basically, what I
think is going on, is that when you click either the "internet" or
"local apps" buttons to authenticate, it sometimes takes longer for the
node to register you as authenticated than it does to redirect you, and
thus it splashes you again. In other words, you'll have to click through
the splash page 2 or 3 times before you actually get redirected to where
you're trying to go. Super annoying!

If you encounter it again, try clicking through a couple more times, and
let me know if it still doesn't redirect you. In the meantime, I'll add
it to my list of things to fix.

Thanks for the report!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Web Browser Certificate Error after Factory
	Reset
Message-ID: <525FDB62.2000707@abaarsotech.org>

In DR2 I've had to do a couple of factory default resets. I've found
that I get the following error in Firefox after factory resting the router:

Secure Connection Failed

An error occurred during a connection to 192.168.1.20. You have received
an invalid certificate. Please contact the server administrator or email
correspondent and give them the following information: Your certificate
contains the same serial number as another certificate issued by the
certificate authority. Please get a new certificate containing a unique
serial number. (Error code: sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial)

    The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the
authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.
Alternatively, use the command found in the help menu to report this
broken site.

I've tried removing the certificates from my Firefox under
preferences>advanced>certificates but still cannot log back into the
router.  Do I have to do something in Firefox or in the router?

Thanks

Dan

I'm still having strange issues with the DNS servers I would like my
requests to be forwarded to on my student network. Under DHCP AND DNS I
have the DNS Forwardings set to two Open DNS servers so I can block
specific content on the student network.  I enabled the log and found these
entries. For some reason the default DNS forwarder that is being used is
Google's 8.8.8.8  No where on any network in the school am I using this
server.  Is there anyway I can get the routers to forward requests to my
open dns servers? Is there a dnsmasq config file I can edit?

Log Files: (the second server 208.67.220.220 is the server I would like to
be the default)

Nameservers are associated with commotiond interface profiles. Each
profile has a dns= line. Just change that to your preferred nameserver.

Profiles are stored in /etc/commotion/profiles.d and are accessed using
the commotion > mesh profile menu. You can either edit your existing
profiles (one per interface) or create new ones, then apply them using
the profile tool.

I've actually found that some of open dns requests are being received and
others are not. The sites that of course I do not want to get forwarded
through Google's servers (youtube, vimeo) are getting through somehow.  I
tried change the default DNS under /tmp/resolv.conf.auto however once the
router reboots it restarts the default back to 8.8.8.8  Any help on this
would be great. Students get back to school today and having 30 or so on
youtube means our network will revert back to 56k speeds of the 90's.   Or
if anyone knows how to block https youtube using firewall rules without
blocking other Google services that would work as well.

Changed the nameservers on the default plug and access point interface but
still was resolving with 8.8.8.8

Oct 18 10:14:32 Computer-Lab3681343115 daemon.info dnsmasq[3142]: forwarded
kat.ph to 8.8.8.8

I also changed the default dns to 208.67.222.222 on the mesh and on the
sec.

I'm still confused how to edit a profile under commotion > mesh profile - I
selected interface > ap (using quickstartAp)

profile > defaultAP and got the following error message

/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:448: Failed to execute call

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] DR2 Memory Issues Is there a Quick Fix?
Message-ID: <CAKxU6K1Bg-VELF9AQaW3+zsL6Q0abGi-gfbAq1+gPp=hueZcSQ@mail.gmail.com>

I was wondering if there was a quick fix to the memory issue that causes
the nodes to crash in DR2.  I know that Dan had mentioned that you could
disable serval even though it disabled the splash screen.  Even that is the
case I'm ok with it as long as if fixes the memory issue for the time
being. Any quick simple explanation would be extremely helpful.  We are
having some serious issues with nodes crashing repeatedly on end over here.

Thanks again!

Dan

Hey Dan,

Disabling Serval won't affect the splash screen, but it will prevent
local app announcements from automatically propagating. Here's how to
turn it off/disable it:

/etc/init.d/serval-dna disable && /etc/init.d/serval-dna stop

Let me know if that doesn't solve the problem!

best,
Dan

What URL are you visiting that causes this error? We are trying to move
away from the 192.168.1.20 alias for the nodes since each node will use
that same address and each present a different self-signed certificate,
resulting in these types of errors.

Can anyone else from the dev team chime in with the status of this?

Have you tried changing the dns server in the commotion profiles
(/etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartAP or something like that)?
Anything in /tmp/ will be lost on reboot, so that's why you're seeing
that behavior.

I am hoping Seamus can chime in with the LuCI error regarding QS values.

Commotion comes with a few default profiles (defaultMesh, defaultAP,
etc). But once you go through the QuickStart, the node creates and
starts using another set of profiles: quickstartPlug, quickstartMesh,
quickstartAP, quickstartSec (or something similar). So those are the
profiles you will want to change.

When I get into the office today I'll take a look at the web interface
for changing the profiles. Are you using DR1 or DR2?

Very cool, thanks for sending this out! Hopefully some of our colleagues
with Macs can give it a try.

Yeah it finally worked after changed all of those profiles default DNS
to the nameserver I wanted to use. I was using DR2 on those nodes.  I

in the web interface.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] DR2 Memory Issues Is there a Quick Fix?
In-Reply-To: <52628D8F.5080100@opentechinstitute.org>
References: <CAKxU6K1Bg-VELF9AQaW3+zsL6Q0abGi-gfbAq1+gPp=hueZcSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Here is a comment I added to a recent github issue re: node memory
consumption and serval, suggesting enabling compressed swap as a
psuedo-workaround.

https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-openwrt/issues/40#issuecomment-25683085

... I suggested adding the "zram-swap" package presently in OpenWRT trunk
to the commotion packages feed, and then enabling swap in kernelconfig.
This would let you enable compressed swap memory on nodes, and ideally make
the memory limit somewhat softer (i.e. help nodes avoid OOM errors and
processes crashing).

So, specifically, do make kernel_menuconfig and make these selections:
General Setup -> Support for paging of anonymous memory (swap) *
Device Drivers -> Staging drivers -> Compressed RAM block device support *

This kernel config change can also be done via a patch, and such a patch is
buried somewhere in openwrt-devel listserv archives (i.e. when the zram
package was originally announced).

Then copy the zram_swap package from trunk into commotionfeed and enable it.

For my nodes with 32MB of RAM, I specify 6MB swap in /etc/config/system:

config system
    ...
    option 'zram_size_mb' '6'

You can periodically check swap usage to ensure nothing is using excessive
RAM:

root at nsm5-b:~# free
             total         used         free       shared      buffers
Mem:         29184        24100         5084            0         2752
-/+ buffers:              21348         7836
Swap:         6140            0         6140

I should note this is only a *pseudo-workaround*, as it does not address
the underlying issue of excessive RAM consumption.  At best, zrap-swap
would allow the node to avoid OOM errors, and furthermore detect it is in a
low-memory state and actively do something about it (e.g. reboot).

I am running zram-swap as described above on WasabiNet nodes, both 5.8GHz
mesh backhaul and 2.4GHz mesh APs, and I can confirm that certain processes
*do not like to be swapped out*, freezing or behaving erratically as a
result.  hostapd, wpa_supplicant, olsrd, crond/busybox, and whatever your
captive portal agent is (nodogsplash or coovachilli), all certainly
shouldn't be swapped out.  Possibly commotiond too, although I've not had
opportunity to test that.

So, the zram_swap method described above lacks a bit in robustness.  I
think the *mlock* command can be used to prevent specific processes from
being swapped out, although I'm uncertain of whether OpenWRT has this tool
integrated.

Just stumbeled across this on the Open ITP Blog:
https://openitp.org/mesh-networks/trevor-ellermann-on-mesh-networks.html

I am curious to know the argument some of you pro-mesh people out there
might have against Trevor's argument of Mesh networks are not the most
suitable network infrastructure for the developing world.

He seems to think that mesh is good in places where it can be constantly
maintained.  I would argue that in our situation since we are not a large
network (4-6 nodes) maintenance is not as much of an issue.

However, I can certainly understand his argument .  We do have one node
that is not the easiest to reach (in a guard tower which means a lot of
climbing and trying not wake sleeping guards) but for remote regions with
many different nodes in a variety of locations troubleshooting may be a
problem.

He also mentions the issue of power.  I've always wanted to play with the
idea of solar powering a pico station. Has anyone seen this been done
before? We have plenty of sun in Africa and far too many unreliable
generators.

I am really intrigued to hear opinions about this argument especially of
those who have worked with both types of networks or certainly have more
knowledge on the subject.

Hey Dan (and all),

Please excuse the delay, and the hastiness of this response. I have not
had much time to sit down to give a comprehensive reply to this
questions, but this deserves a response. As, I only have a dozen or so
minutes to write this, I want to point out that it only represents my
personal views and has not been vetted by the full team... or really any
of them.

I actually had the good fortune of having a few conversations with
Trevor after that article went live. While I will comment more below I
think it really comes down to the deployment model, and the current
state of networking education.

Trevor has worked extensively with communities to provide internet
connectivity with limited overall access to unfiltered/any internet and
to train the individuals there on how to maintain those networks. As
such, if any part of the network goes down it is easy to pinpoint the
problem. This makes it far easier to manage a network for a user who
only has the basic networking knowledge taught to them (having spoken to
Trevor I believe that it was surely a very high quality and
comprehensive set of training they received). It also means that if the
network manager is not around to, or is unwilling to provide
connectivity to other surrounding areas those areas have no choice but
to find a "Trevor" to assist them, or go without.

He is right in many ways, but I personally believe that the challenge we
must take on is to make the construction, management, and diagnosis of
mesh networks more easily understood and taken on by individuals so that
the network can easily spread where it is needed. I think that
optimizing a network for performance should also includes creating
community guidelines about usage and educating members on how to
identify the health of their part of the network and tune their node
accordingly. But, that still requires far, far, clearer, more powerful
tools and much more education material to make possible. That is what we
are doing with the Commotion project.

Really, my argument is not a disagreement with the thoughts Trevor has.
It is a completely different intervention style based upon capacity and
the power of the network-manager. This planet has yet to see capable
individuals flocking to provide connectivity to those in need. It is far
too profitable to control avenues of communication, and far to hard to
gain the expertise and time needed to build and maintain networks at
large scale (though luckily it is getting cheaper to do). There are
groups of amazing technologists, like Trevor, who are doing amazing work
providing managed networks and the education to maintain them.  But, the
disparity is to great, and the locations to many to have people like
Trevor go out to all the communities that need him.

For these, and many other reasons, we have focused on developing tools
and educational materials that allow a community to assess their needs
and create the basic connectivity that they are lacking. We feel that
when a Trevor is not available, mesh networking has the best chance for
providing an infrastructure that will be able to grow as a community
needs it to grow. (I keep saying me because I have picked up much of
this philosophy from other members of OTI and the Commotion team, but I
should point out again that this quick overview only represents my
personal views on this project.)

Maintenance is such a hard problem for long standing networks. Simply
looking at the node-maps of various community wireless projects with an
eye to the version field of unconnected nodes will show dozens, if not
hundreds, of forgotten, unreachable, or otherwise unmaintainable nodes.
I have heard from many that it is just not worth the time unless they
start interfering with the network. Some of these projects are mesh,
some are managed. A house changes ownership or a store changes
management and all of a sudden a roof is off limits or an ethernet cable
unplugged without any real recourse. I think that funkfeuer and guifi
might actually have people sign contracts when they offer their roof for
usage to have some legal looking paper to hopefully convince the new
owners to at least let them reclaim the hardware.

But all that is to say that maintainance is both a hardware/software
problem, as well as a education and community engagement problem. The
Commotion project has put out, and is continuing to develop a good deal
of materials on both the actual mounting of a node
https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/building-mounting/prep-install-rooftop-nodes
but, also in the outreach and planning stages that will allow
communities to build the human infrastructure that will support
long-term maintenance. It is a much harder lift but, by documenting
working community models for maintaining communications infrastructure
over time it creates a more resilient human network to support a
deployed network. https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck (keep an eye
out for the next set of planning guides which will have more of this
focus in them.)

There was a person at IS4CWN who was doing power measurements on a
pico-station to make buying the right solar panel/batteries easier.  I
am almost sure I have seen it working before as well. The Southern
California Tribal Digita Village
(http://www.newamerica.net/files/New_Media_Technology_and_Internet_Use_in_Indian_Country.pdf)
runs 5 backbone nodes on mountain-tops off of solar arrays. It is a much
more solid infrastructure, but something to look to for large long-term
solar networks.

Hi All,

I also had the fortune to chat with Trevor about his adventures in distant
lands, and yes, we ended up more or less agreeing on each others' opinions
of mesh topology vs. more traditional hub & spoke networks.  Indeed, I'm
keen on wireless meshes, but specifically on partitioned meshes that span
multiple channels and/or bands to ensure realistic bandwidth availability.
Trevor has a strong need to set up reliable networks quickly, using
available, off-the-shelf equipment, with handy documentation.

The IS4CWN summits, and the community mesh movement at large, have made
fantastic progress towards this end, but there is still work to do to win
over the Trevors and the Matt Rantanens of the world that they can find
benefit in using mesh.  From a high level, promoting interoperability
between different meshing schemes, a al the goals of the Interop group at
http://interop.wlan-si.net/ would definitely help reduce the learning curve
for mesh.  Also, the fact that Trevor came to speak at the summit shows
this progress is under way.

As for solar power, it was Danny Iland from USCB who gave a presentation in
Berlin about hyper-precise power measurements and solar / battery size
estimation.  If you don't have it, I can share Danny's email address
off-list (in consideration of privacy).

To this great discussion, I'll add one slightly more obscure point: In
my experience speaking with people who have next to no experience with
wireless networking, there's something about mesh that makes intuitive
sense. I think it's that the flexibility makes it easier to align with
the social networks we experience in our daily lives.

If you tell people there will be one leader and anyone who wants to say
anything to anyone else has to pass a message through the leader, that
doesn't sound very appealing. On the other hand, if you say that anyone
can speak to anyone else as long as we take turns, can see each other,
and don't talk too loudly, that seems right.

So, yes, mesh networking has some added technical overhead, but as a
digital expression of the world we want, it's a lot more appealing than
hub-and-spoke.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion-discuss Digest, Vol 13, Issue 9
In-Reply-To: <mailman.20283.1382092364.4037.commotion-discuss@lists.chambana.net>
References: <mailman.20283.1382092364.4037.commotion-discuss@lists.chambana.net>
Message-ID: <CAKxU6K2Jxn8N4Bztk=C1Wz51w-qZMhi-ov_iyNBFNCs2onzH1w@mail.gmail.com>

Issue resolved. I believe my profile was the quickstartAP.  Is there a
simple way to change the namservers in the gui or was that under Network >
DHCP and DNS and it wasn't working?  Is there anyway that choosing a
nameserver could be included into the quickstart? Thanks for the help.

Dan

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion-discuss Digest, Vol 13, Issue 12
In-Reply-To: <mailman.22698.1382364587.4037.commotion-discuss@lists.chambana.net>
References: <mailman.22698.1382364587.4037.commotion-discuss@lists.chambana.net>

In regards to the certificate error message I've been getting. I've been
trying to access the router from whatever URL was randomly generated for
the router in this case 101.100.79.1 or the assigned IP I manually gave the
plug interface in this case 192.168.8.2. Each ip still gives me the same
same error message.  I found this article:
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/Certificate%20contains%20the%20same%20serial%20number%20as%20another%20certificate

somewhat helpful.  Removing the servers is easy since you can find the IP
address of the server and remove it. Removing the certificate authority
where it gets confusing.  I have no idea who generated the certificate
authority so I do not know which one to remove from the authorities tab.  I
still cannot access most of my routers from Firefox.

Hi Dan,

When a browser sees a self-signed or unknown certificate, it will give
you a warning, then ask you to either accept it, or reject it. If you
accept it, by default it will save it *permanently*, which is likely
where your trouble comes from.

The first time you connected to 101.100.79.1, you probably accepted the
certificate, and so now your browser permanently associates that IP
address with that particular certificate at that time. If you have since
reflashed the node, that same IP address will now have a *different*
certificate, and your browser freaked out and won't let you proceed.

So the solution is first to remove the cached certificate associated
with that IP address from your browser, as you already did. After that,
you can either do the same thing every time you reflash the node, or you
can accept the certificate *temporarily* instead of permanently. Here's
a Firefox add-on I use that makes the default browser behavior to accept
certificates temporarily:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/y-u-no-validate/.

Regarding your certificate authority question, the certificates
presented by the nodes are self-signed, meaning they have no certificate
authority.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, let me know! Seamus
was working on documentation regarding the certificate warnings, so
maybe he has a section about how the browser caches them?

Message-ID: <CAEpPpNKRvCCtaPhAxemf=Z+-wJr7+S4WU=Az26XJzpqu9KFnaA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all-

I'm working with my media lab class on an off-the-grid emergency response
mesh network.  We want to integrate messaging.  I was initially
experimenting with a Jabber server but decided serverless messaging would
better solve the problem- we want to avoid centralization as much as
possible so that if one node goes down, folks can still communicate across
the LAN or WAN

I ran across a description of an XMPP-like serverless messaging system:
http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html

Anyone have any experience or insights?

Thanks-
Evan

Doesn't Serval have a messaging implementation that they've used on Android
handsets?

Yes Ben, they do- but it is embedded with the Serval Mesh package which, as
you point out, runs on Android handsets.  We are using BATMAN with Pis as
WAPs and routers, as well as with an existing mesh running over TP-Link
routers- so I want something that can run across different platforms
(Linux, Mac OS, Windows, Android) and is independent of their system.

Right after I posted, of course I found
kouchat<https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/>which runs on everything
but IPhones.  It does the trick, but I would like
to find something that allows for MUCs.

Thanks Dean, will check it out.

Evan,

You might want to check out my project MediaGrid:
http://mediagrid.disman.tl/

It implements a decentralized, encrypted webchat service (as well as
file sharing), and was designed to run on Raspberry Pis in a mesh network.

It's decentralized in that each Pi (or whatever device running it) has a
database of messages that it continuously synchronizes with the other
devices on the mesh, constantly updating with new messages. You can also
do private messages to other users in the webchat, similar to IRC.

Thanks Dan!

That is exactly what I am looking for.  The replicated database is
crucial.  I'll get it up on our sandbox server asap.  I figured you all
would be working on something like that to complement Commotion.

Another question-  I want to implement GIS servers and an emergency CRM on
the Pis but still retain survivability if one or more of the devices gets
knocked out.  Any thoughts on using an Anycast routing scheme and multiple
instances of the CRM and map server to achieve this?  I'm I barking up the
wrong tree?

Best-
E

It depends on how you want to access it, I suppose. If not every node is
running the GIS & CRM servers, then anycast could theoretically work
well, as long as the servers again are in sync. Personally, I don't have
any experience using anycast for fallback support.

What I designed MediaGrid to do was to have each instance advertise
itself on the mesh using multicast DNS. That way, each node collects a
list of all the other nodes running MediaGrid, and starts bi-directional
synchronization with each of them. CouchDB makes this synchronization
super easy and hands off, which is why I use it for the back end. Here's
a script that does the automatic peer discovery and synchronization, in
case it's helpful for your GIS & CRM server idea:

Not sure how we ended up not on commotion-discuss, but re-sending...

I imagine you could also just host all of the GIS and CRM files in couchDB
as well, potentially in the form of a couchapp (
http://couchapp.org/page/index) and work with Leaflet as the front end for
the map.

We were thinking about this idea for Tidepools (tidepools.co), which is
currently uses MongoDB, but could be restructured to work on top of couchDB.

Also re:GIS... Vector maps are much smaller and easier to store, so you
might opt for Vector over raster map data if you are working on the RPi.

This happened to me at least couple times on my Mac.  I installed Google
Chrome to access the node because Firefox kept giving me the certificate
error with no option to move forward...I had been flashing/setting up
multiple nodes with my computer.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Security and remote management for embedded
	devices
Message-ID: <529DE2DA.2000802@opentechinstitute.org>

I just finished reading a very interesting talk by cybersecurity expert
Dan Geer: http://geer.tinho.net/geer.suitsandspooks.8ii12.txt.

The talk is pretty broad and waxes philosophical, but it brings up some
interesting points about increasing attack surfaces (especially with
proliferating embedded systems), automation, and the ability of humans
to manage the security of increasingly interdependent networks. Some of
this we can apply to Commotion:


"So should or should not an embedded system have a remote management
interface?  If it does not, then a late discovered flaw cannot be
fixed without visiting all the embedded systems which is likely to
be infeasible both because some will be where you cannot again go
and there will be too many of them anyway.  If it does have a remote
management interface, the opponent of skill focuses on that and,
once a break is achieved, will use those self-same management
functions to ensure that not only does he retain control over the
long interval but, as well, you will be unlikely to know that he
is there.

Perhaps what is needed is for at least some computers to be more
like humans, and I most assuredly do not mean artificially intelligent.
By "more like humans" I mean this: Embedded systems, if having no
remote management interface and thus out of reach, are a life form
and as the purpose of life is to end, an embedded system without a
remote management interface must be so designed as to be certain
to die no later than some fixed time.  Conversely, an embedded
system with a remote management interface must be sufficiently
self-protecting that it is capable of refusing a command.  Inevitable
death and purposive resistance are two aspects of the human condition
we need to replicate, not somehow imagine that to overcome them is
to make an improvement."


I know for a fact there are Commotion networks and nodes out there that
have been abandoned, are using wildly out of date firmware, but are
probably still reachable in public spaces. What is our responsibility to
those devices (can I allude to Shelley's Frankenstein here?)? Certainly
the end-user has the freedom to setup and modify their Commotion devices
however they want, but would it be wise, security-wise, for us to
implement by default some sort of end-of-life mechanism for nodes that
aren't actively maintained or managed through a remote administration tool?

Just some food for thought...

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Building a Mesh Network in Rural Somaliland
Message-ID: <52A9B406.7070105@opentechinstitute.org>

Many thanks to Dan Hastings for writing and photographing his experience
setting up a Commotion network in Somaliland:
http://oti.newamerica.net/blogposts/2013/building_a_mesh_network_in_rural_somaliland-98554

I also like how the map of network nodes is shaped almost exactly like
the Commotion logo!

Building a Mesh Network in Rural Somaliland
Published:  December 11, 2013

by Daniel Hastings

I had heard about mesh networking before I arrived in Somaliland, but
had never been in the position to actually build a mesh network. When I
accepted the position as ICT instructor at Abaarso School of Science and
Technology in Abaarso, Somaliland, I figured this may be my chance. I
knew that the Open Technology Institute (OTI) had been developing a mesh
firmware called Commotion, suitable for remote locations. Upon arriving
in Somaliland I decided that building a mesh network using Commotion
would be one of my top priorities.

It seemed like building a mesh network could be a difficult process. I
experimented in the past with other firmware on a variety of routers,
but found the configuration to be too time-consuming and difficult to
set up.
I knew Commotion ran on Ubiquti hardware, designed for rough outdoor
environments like Somaliland. Unfortunately, finding Ubiquti routers in
Somaliland -- for that matter, getting anything into Somaliland -- is no
easy task.

Somaliland is an independent autonomous region of Somalia, and is an
area that is safe compared to the southern regions of Somalia. While not
internationally recognized as a country, Somaliland has its own
currency, government, and military.

The analogy I like to use when it comes to traveling to Somaliland is no
different than that of getting to Hogwarts. Instead of running head
first into an imaginary platform at the train station, you have to land
in Dubai, catch a flight that leaves only once a week and then travel
across a desert on one of the worst-built roads you can imagine.

While back in the US this past summer I contacted OTI and found that
they would be able to provide me with the proper equipment to run and
set up a mesh network using Commotion. I was so excited about the
possibility of actually getting all of the equipment into Somaliland
that I carefully packed everything into my carry-on.

Before I go any further, I should explain my level of experience with
building networks. My only experience with networking had been taking a
class at a community college in San Francisco and spending the last year
troubleshooting our Internet problems at school. However, Commotion is
built in such a way that little if any advanced configuration is
necessary to set up a mesh network.

I first began building my network by identifying where I wanted access
points on campus and mapping out distances between each spot. Having a
good line of sight between each node was extremely important. Luckily we
have a lot of high guard and water towers on campus so placing nodes was
not an issue.

One minor problem with placing nodes in towers was that I had to ensure
a reliable power source was within range of the node. If all my nodes
were solar-powered, I would not have had to worry about running any
cable at all!

I next had to ?flash? each router, which means loading the Commotion
firmware on to each Ubiquti device. I had experience flashing firmware
onto routers before but had never ?meshed? wireless nodes together. To
help with this I referred to the configuration examples on Commotion?s
website, which I found extremely helpful. Open source software has been
known to be tricky to configure and maintain but it certainly does not
have to be. Commotion has proved this to be more than true.

While building the network, I made sure to include students as much as I
could. I assembled together a computer club of my top ICT students to
discuss and teach the basics of mesh networking, how to flash firmware
onto routers, and how to add a node to the network. Together we ran
cable and climbed water towers to place the nodes in their proper
places. We also had to place some nodes in the guard towers which often
times, the guards would unplug accidentally. Students trained the guards
on the difference between the LAN and PoE ports as well as the
importance of keeping the PoE cable plugged in at all times. A few weeks
after school we put up the last two nodes for the girls? dorms and the
boys? dorms.

Local Applications and Limited Bandwidth

Somaliland is currently the only country in Africa that lacks fiber
optic access -- cables are laid but access is not predicted to be
available until 2014. Somaliland receives its Internet connection via
microwaves across the desert from Djibouti. All of the IP address ranges
in Somaliland will tell you that you are in Djibouti. The distant
gateway connectivity, not to mention unreliable ISPs, equates to some
seriously slow Internet.

A lack of consistent access to the Internet is an ICT instructor?s
nightmare. Not being able to teach the most current technologies can be
frustrating, and it also hampers sharing files with students.
Mesh networking is described as a ?peer to peer network:? I wanted to
use the full sense of the term and make file sharing among my students
easy and manageable. In order to solve this communication problem I
decided to rely less on the outside Internet and rely more on local
applications installed on our servers.

I found the solution to our inconsistent and slow Internet by installing
OwnCloud, an open source alternative to Dropbox, on our local server.
Now students could share homework assignments with me and other teachers
without having to rely on the Internet at all.

Creating a Self-Sufficient Network

As well as the network worked and as much fun as setting it up was, I
cannot call this project successful until I can come back to Somaliland
a year from now and see the same nodes in place running the same network.
I used a few methods to make sure this would be the case. I was careful
to document every aspect of the project and create detailed guides for
teachers and future network administrators on everything from how to
find your IP address on the network to how to ping a node, which is
important for isolating a potential problem on the network. Even though
mesh networks are ?self-healing?, they are not perfect and still have
their quirks.

Having all of the knowledge centered in one place with one staff member
will only set an organization up for failure, so I've made sure to give
a series of small trainings to the entire staff.

The more transparent you are about how the network works, the more
likely the technology will last.

I repeatedly told my students that some of the greatest makers and
technologists of our time were self-taught. The excellent support
community centered around open source software makes projects such as
Commotion sustainable. There is a good chance that if a problem arises,
someone else already had that issue or someone in another community
across the globe is working on a solution to that problem.

I would like to give my sincere gratitude to the Commotion Wireless
Project for the support they gave me along with providing me with
necessary tools to build this network. Not only did the students at
Abaarso School get extremely enthused about mesh networking and learn
the meaning of community technology, but now another small part of a
country that, technically, does not even exist is more connected to the
rest of the world.

I have been reading so many mails in this group for a few months and
it has been a good learning experience. Now i have a practical issue
of wireless connectivity that needs a solution.

What technology is good to cover rural areas with dispersed population
to provide WiFi in rural areas.

One suggestion i have got is that LTE tower with a range of 30 km with
Line of sight visibility can be used.

If any of you can give me some idea on the best technology to cover a
wide area on a low cost using a mesh network, it would be very
helpful.

Thanks.

Hi Commotion Friends

I tested commotion 1.0 with Andy Gunn when he was in town and we installed
commotion
on one Nanostation and one Picostation. After the initial install commotion
worked well but as soon as one was rebooted they quit meshing with each
other.

We re-flashed the routers and got the same result the second time as well.

I believe Andy put in a Bug fix request with the developers but I wondered
if you knew when the next build would be ready to go or if there was a work
around? We can't deploy the new version if it is broken. I've been
monitoring the commotion email groups and surprisingly no-one has mentioned
this issue.

We are also teaching a new batch of digital stewards so I am hoping it
might get fixed before we get to router flashing part of the curriculum.

Good luck to you all and thanks for all of your help!

Hi Anderson,

We also noticed the bug you are talking about, and there was a recent
code change that should have fixed it. You can see the fix here:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond/pull/82

Andy's bug report is here, and could probably be closed out:
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router/issues/93

Regarding a new version, we are planning to push out version 1.1 by the
end of the month, which will contain a number of bug fixes. When does
the flashing section of the Digital Stewards training start?

Thanks for bringing this up!

Dan

That sounds great.
Poletown Mesh (5 routers on Detroit's East side) is also waiting for
updates.
We are ready to deploy 5 more routers but are waiting for v1.1

This is also something I would like to know how to do!

There should be a way to run a cron job to schedule a reboot. I just don't
know how to do it in commotion, maybe one of the guru's can ring in?

There is a page in the administrative web interface where you can
schedule periodic tasks. It's under Advanced->System->Scheduled Tasks.
To schedule a daily reboot, add the following line:

0 0 * * * /sbin/reboot

That will make the node reboot at midnight (the second zero specifies
the hour of the day (24-hour-format) to do the task).

Is there a particular reason you want it to reboot daily?

Thanks Dan!

The DR2 Nano on top of AMP goes down/loses the gateway almost weekly and I
have to reboot it then it works fine for another week or two.
I thought a scheduled restart once and a while might be a good temporary
work-around for intermittent issues like that.

Dan/Anderson - do you think that's maybe a nodogsplash issue? I know we had
seen issues with nodogsplash along those lines... right?

Am I remembering the wrong thing?

NDS has never caused problems like that as far as I've seen.

Hello All,

We will be doing some work on the OLSR-Visualizer over the next two
months. We want to get your thoughts to make sure that we don't remove
any useful functionality, and that we improve the major pain points that
currently exist. As such, we would appreciate feedback to the following
questions.


1) How do you currently use the olsr-viz? (e.g. What types of tasks is
the visualizer better for than other status menu's? What other
information do you compare the visualizer against in order to fully
complete the main tasks you use the viz for?)

2) What is most important to you from the current viz. (e.g. What parts
of the current visualizer are vital to the tasks that you do? What would
you miss if we removed it?)

3) What parts of the current viz do you not like? (e.g. What are the
pain points that make using the viz difficult, confusing, or annoying?)


We appreciate your feedback.

Currently we usually look at the viz for a quick snapshot of the network
health.

When we are looking to see if a link works, or if a node is online we
turn it on and scan for that link or node. When we have a problem we
turn on the viz and look for the color of the link to see if it is a
routing problem.

We often compare viz data with ping tests to the services/internet that
we are trying to reach through those nodes.

The colored lines, node names, and different icons for gateways vs.
non-gateway nodes are really useful for getting an at-a-glance view of
the network. Though, we would like solid lines and the nodes to be solid
colors so it is easier to identify things at a glance.

We HATE the auto-sort jitter/movement of the current viz. It means that
we have to spend time clicking and dragging nodes back on screen to see
what the network looks like.  The ETX value is also confusing to new
node administrators Since it is on a scale of [1-5/infinity]. It should
probably be replaced by another value on a scale of 0-100% or some other
scale that makes sense to people who don't have OLSR's link quality
algorithm memorized.

John and Anderson,

If you all could get a dump of debug info (look for the debug menu in
the web interface) whenever the node meshing stops working, that would
greatly help us improve Commotion and fix whatever problems are causing
that to occur. There's only so much we can do in the test network in our
office, and it would greatly benefit the project to get detailed info
from actual deployed networks.

HI Matt,

As an operator of a small, mesh-based micro-WISP in St. Louis which
supports itself (barely) using a Freemium model, thank you for sharing
this.  Off-hand, I can offer these comments.

- The biggest factor to establishing a WISP, clearly, would be who is your
upstream ISP.  It's fair to assume cable and DSL providers won't sell to
you, leaving fiber.  Depending on the availability of lower cost aerial
fiber (it's not available in St. Louis, for example), your uplink may
likely cost single-digit $1000's per month.  Cheaper, i.e. below $2000/mo,
can be done if you have a relationship with a nearby data house who is
willing let you mount something like UBNT AirFiber on their roof
inexpensively for your backhaul.  But don't see surprised by expectations
of ~$1000/mo roof rights.

- The figures for subscriber equipment (i.e. the CPE) and installation
labor are spot on.  I'd recommend adding whatever fractional of the ISP
cost for each subscriber to better gauge the business' sustainability.
E.g. $2000/mo uplink cost spread across 100 subscribers = $20/mo raw ISP
cost per subscriber.

- I would also recommend adding a line item to your spreadsheet for some
3rd party portal / payment handling service like
GateSpot<http://store.wisp-router.com/GateSpot>,
e.g. invoice generation, credit card processing, etc.  It is possible to
run your own portal and payment gateway via freeRADIUS / Drupal / Ubercart
/ Paypal / Dwolla / etc, but there's a steep learning curve.

- I'd also recommend making an estimate on subscriber attrition / loyalty.
Not everyone is going to pay their subscription fee, and your small
business' ability to follow-up with each and every person who falls behind
is very finite.  Estimating, for example, 15% non-paying subscribers as
part of normal operation (and scaling expected revenue to cover that gap),
could allow for much more efficient operation.

- Insurance for installed equipment is a good idea, especially if this
business is otherwise unable to roll trucks to repair damage after a large
wind storm.  For example, a previous list member mentioned getting $1M
liability on their rooftop gear for $425 annual premium from this carrier:
http://www.techinsurance.com/default10.aspx

- In an urban environment, using mesh transport over 2.4GHz is just not
going to work reliably beyond the scale of a single block or so.  This is
made ever more frustrating by the proliferation of consumer WiFi routers
that hop channels (especially those distributed by the millions by the
cable company), ensuring there will never be a consistently free channel.
I can confirm this from operating UBNT Nano M2s that have difficulty
maintaining adequate signal just down a single neighborhood block, despite
both units being shielded with RF Armor.  Also, there isn't really a good
solution yet for meshes to channel hop reliably, although someone will be
making a presentation about draft implementation at this year's Battlemesh.

- Pretty much all WISPs, along with some of the larger mesh network
operators on this list (myself included), thus use 5.8GHz for backhaul over
distances greater than a block.  However, this band is also getting much
much noisier, and I'm expecting the noise level that renders the 2.4GHz
band largely unusable for me here in St. Louis to transition over to 5.8GHz
in a couple years.  (Thanks again, in part, to the cable company who is
selling dual-band WiFi routers preprogrammed for full TX power to every new
subscriber.)  Non-meshing WISPs are gradually switching their backhaul
operations over to the DFS bands, which require active radar detection for
legal operation.  That same Battlemesh presentation mentioned above will be
for a draft Open Source implementation for DFS compliance, but to my
knowledge, no FCC-approved option exists yet for running adhoc over DFS
channels.

- Finally, White Space, or TVWS, is clearly an intriguing option for
wider-spaced rural areas (although still very pricey, ~$10k).
Unfortunately, my understanding is that can not handle the typical user
density for urban areas.

Hi John - thanks for writing about this. I know that one of our testing
networks uses Zabbix (http://www.zabbix.com/) to monitor the status of
nodes, though I don't know much about it.

I'm hoping someone that manages that network (or has experience with
Zabbix) can chime in and describe how it is set up!

Somewhat related to my previous post about tracking the status of Gateway nodes, I've noticed that OLSR-Viz only shows the node that I am connected to as a Gateway. The other nodes are shown as Basic nodes despite being directly connected to the internet.

Am I mis-reading the OLSR-Viz symbology or is there another view that shows the Gateway status of all the nodes in our mesh network?

Hi John,

In my experience, when I'm connected to a gateway node, it shows itself
as the only gateway on the network in OLSR-Viz. But when I'm connected
to a non-gateway node, it seems to show all the gateways in OLSR-Viz. I
haven't paid attention enough to confirm this, but it just seems to be a
limitation of the way OLSRd reports HNAs/gateways in its txtinfo and
jsoninfo plugins.

There are definitely plans to replace OLSR-Viz with something much
better, comparable to what other projects like Freifunk and AlterMundi
use, but I can't really say how far off that is.

The gateway flag in the current olsr-viz simply looks for a host network
announcement of "0.0.0.0" from a node. I don't know if smart-gateway
impacts how the node collects HNA's from other devices when a node is
already a gateway.

I will add this to my notes on the new OLSR-Viz rewrite for clients. I
am planning to compile the feedback from the lists into a draft spec of
the new OLSR-Viz and sending it back to the lists in a couple of weeks
for a final round of feedback.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] 4/5 NYC: Eyebeam Square: An Internet Blackout
	Simulation Event
Message-ID: <533EC03F.6020502@opentechinstitute.org>

Sorry for not sending this out sooner. But if you'll be in NYC tomorrow,
come just us and Guardian Project for this fun event!

Eyebeam Square: An Internet Blackout Simulation Event

Event Type: workshop
Start Date: 5 Apr 2014
Hours: 10:00AM-5:00PM
Cost: $25
Venue: Eyebeam

Register here! http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/571944

In this workshop, Eyebeam will turn into an "Internet Blackout" or
"Practocalypse" (Practice Apocalypse), where there is no Internet, just
mobile phones and mesh routers.  The Guardian Project and Commotion will
show participants how to use mesh networking in combination with various
mobile and desktop apps to operate in an environment in which, for some
reason, intended or unintended, Internet is not available.  By playing
an interactive role game we will get people thinking and talking about
the need to create decentralized Internet networks and Internet
ownership, and the practical steps that people can take as individuals
in order to improve the situation.

ABOUT THE INSTRUCTORS:

Commotion is a free, open-source communication tool that uses mobile
phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized
mesh networks. Commotion provides a way to share Internet connection but
it is not a replacement for it.

The Guardian Project creates easy-to-use open source apps, mobile OS
security enhancements, and customized mobile devices for people around
the world to help them communicate more freely, and protect themselves
from intrusion and monitoring.

PREREQUISITES + SCHEDULE:

Routers will be provided during the workshop but participants are
welcome to bring their own (Ubiquiti PicoStation M2-HP or Ubiquiti
NanoStation M2)

Session 1: 10:00AM - 1:00PM

Participants will be assigned with tasks to be finished by the end of
the day. In order to complete them they will need to use GP apps. This
first half of the day will be used to download the apps and learn to use
them (i.e. Storymaker, Orbot, Orweb, Ostel, Chatsecure, Pixelnot,
InformaCam).  By the end of the session the internet will go down.

Session 2: 1:30PM - 4:00PM

We will work to setup street-level pop-up mesh networks outdoors to
accomplish these tasks.

Register here!

Hi John - thanks for writing about this. I know that one of our testing
networks uses Zabbix (http://www.zabbix.com/) to monitor the status of
nodes, though I don't know much about it.

I'm hoping someone that manages that network (or has experience with
Zabbix) can chime in and describe how it is set up!

You're right Paul, it looks like there's a problem with missing
downloads on the website. We'll try to fix that as soon as we can!

Message-ID: <CAKenKpL_6=FY+KaP=C=Hd7+s+jXKyw=EPjN8nOfL7Z4gt=i73Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to flash a couple of  picostations with 1.1rc1 following
instructions on the commotion site.
After I flash I can not for the life of me get the routers to give me an IP
address
I have my laptops set to dhcp
I've restarted the routers but I only get loopback address.

Anyone else experiencing this problem with the picostation and 1.1rc1?
Thanks!

I had that problem at the Eyebeam event, but I restarted the router  
and then after a good bit of time (a minute or two, or maybe more) it  
gave me a lease.

Thanks for the input...
I waited,  tried rebooting when it was plugged in then with it unplugged
with no dice.

I ended up powering it on with the reset button on for like 30 seconds,
power it back off then back on and held for another 30 seconds then it gave
me an IP yay!

Thanks for keeping us posted on this Anderson - I haven't seen this
issue before. Anyone else on the list(s) had this issue? Devs - ever
seen this?

I am running through some upgrade testing today and tomorrow, so if this
occurs I will let you know.

I haven't seen it before. But it does take a minute or two to hand out
IP addresses right after the node boots, since it has to wait a bit to
see if whatever it is connected to is handing out IP addresses first.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Grumpy Cat 1.1  mesh with 1.0 ?
Message-ID: <5355E714.4040803@wisc.edu>

will Grumpy Cat 1.1rc1 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)
mesh with
Grumpy Cat 1.0 / LuCI 0.11.1 Release (0.11.1)  ?

I recently installed Grumpy Cat 1.1rc1 on a new picostation M2  but it is not meshing with my two existing picostations that are running Grumpy Cat 1.0.

I don't want to experiment with our mesh since that would cut off users, so I am hoping to get some guidance before proceeding with upgrades to the existing picostations.
Any ideas?
thanks,
john

Hi John,

1.1 will mesh with 1.0, but there's a catch.

There was a bug in 1.0 that would frequently generate invalid BSSIDs
(i.e., a BSSID beginning with anything but 02:). It's fixed in 1.1, but
the buggy 1.0 BSSIDs will not mesh with the valid 1.1 BSSIDs.

I updated our routers from 1.0 to 1.1 only to find that users were required to click through the welcome splash screen regardless of the fact that I set the welcome screen to off.  That with several other things like the stations not remeshing after a reboot convinced me to flash back to grumpy 1.0 . It's hard to promote Commotion if I can't even get the welcome screen turned off. My neighbors find the welcome screen interferes with their use of the internet.

For commotion to be widely adopted it needs to be fool proof.  As a fool that could not get grumpy 1.1 to run right, I worry that Commotion may never really get off the ground unless it is made more fool proof.  For the time being, I'm willing to try to keep things working but me and my neighbors need a system we can depend on every minute of every day.

Hey Grumpy,


Thanks! Getting these kinds of issues identified when we are still in
the release candidate phase allows us to make sure these kinds of issues
don't effect users after the actual release.

I flashed a router with Version 1.1rc1 and could not reproduce the issue
you described.

I opened a issue for this on our github
https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion-splash/issues/28 . I
would appreciate it  greatly if you could review the steps I followed
and let me know what I did differently so I can better evaluate how to
reproduce the issue you saw.

Knowing the router you used will be a big help here. Also, if you can
run the commotion-debugger on your 1.0 build and send that to me
(directly and not on the list) I can update a router from exactly your
configuration to triangulate what the issue is.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention. I hope we can figure out what
the problem is.

s2e

Lastly, I appreciate the "Sleepless in Seattle" vibe of "grumpy in
madison." :)

There is a facebook page "Mesh Sayada", and it would probably be  
easiest just to join the group and post something there asking them  
about it. The splash page was designed by the Ubuntu Tunisia group.

The FCC's endorsement of a "Fast Lane" pretty much conflicts exactly with
what Net Neutrality advocates had been pressing for.  It is not "neutral."

That said, ISPs are correct in that delivering copious amounts of streaming
content from Netflix, Hulu, etc to their subscribers do indeed incur them a
large cost to transport specifically that content, so they have motivation
to recoup those costs via higher usage fees or by charging Netflix, Hulu,
etc. directly.  Nevertheless, it is illuminating to re-parse the ISPs'
argument that, yes, they do indeed sell their subscribers access to the
entire Internet, but that service now would no longer include the
expectation of fast access to certain content providers (e.g. Netflix,
Hulu) who don't already have some "fast-lane" arrangement with the ISPs.

So, the ISPs are hoping the FCC officially greenlights their desire to
offer tiered access to the Internet, based on whatever terms the ISPs
choose to set, whether justified by actual operational costs of delivering
streaming content, or just simply arbitrary.

My personal opinion, for the sake of elegance, is that 5Mbit/s, 10Mbit/s,
20Mbit/s or whatever speed access to the Internet should be access at that
speed to the entire Internet.  If lots of ISP subscribers want fast access
to Netflix's servers, for example, that should simply be a cost of doing
business for that ISP, who would then be free to recoup that cost by
raising their rates, streamlining their internal operation for faster
transport, etc.  Indeed, competing ISPs may be able to offer sufficiently
fast access to Netflix for lower rates, and if so, that's perfectly fine.
The market would be a level playing field.

The "Fast Lane" is *not* a level playing field.  It permits the largest
ISPs to collude over what content they chose to offer at useful speeds, and
it reduces their motivation to make system-wide upgrades or improvements
for increased bandwidth for everyone.

Hello everyone. First time caller. I couldnt figure out how to search the
archives, so apologies if this has been discussed elsewhere.

We are trying to install Zabbix on some of our Commotion nodes. I have a
couple questions.

I dont see the Configuration tab/button on the top of the Zabbix page, the
one I would use to add a new host. Is it possible that my admin privileges
dont allow me to do this?

Also, a couple of the nodes have it installed correctly on the router, but
only report a couple types of info.  MAc 802.11 and WIFI, but WIFI only has
SNR data.

I have attached a screen shot, which shows both of these issues.
thanks
tony

 speed gains?, (Dan Staples)

Hi John,

We definitely intend to add OLSRv2 as an option soon, though we also
intend to continue to support OLSRv1 until or unless it is completely
superseded. However, the question of whether it would do what you want
is complex, as there are at least three different factors at play.

The first, which is: can OLSR take gateway bandwidth into account when
it selects a gateway? This is actually something that OLSRv1 can do,
though we don't enable it by default as it's relatively new and fairly
complex. OLSRv1 has SmartGateway, which we enable by default and which
uses IP-over-IP tunnels in order to select and use gateways in such a
way that it helps to avoid breaking connections when a new gateway
becomes 'closer' (you have a better path to it) than your old gateway.
SmartGateway also provides parameters that are disabled by default for
tuning whether the capacity of the gateway is taken into account when
selecting which gateway to use (i.e., whether to sometimes use a fat
pipe that is further away than a thin pipe that is closer). However, the
values that a gateway advertises are not dynamic (OLSR has no inherent
way of 'knowing' how much bandwidth its upstream link has) so the values
it uses are upstream and downstream bandwidth parameters set manually in
the configuration file. So if you knew the speed of a particular
connection, you could set it manually in the config file and set every
other node in the network to take that into account when choosing a gateway.

Relatively recently, a plugin called sgdynspeed was added to OLSR. This
basically allow OLSR to periodically read a text file that contains
updated bandwidth values, and update what SmartGateway advertises for
that gateway accordingly. So what it would be possible to do is set up
some kind of automated bandwidth test that would write its results into
the text file, use sgdynspeed to read that text file and update OLSR's
values for that gateway, and have the other nodes in the network take
that into account when selecting a gateway. Thereby, you can allow for
your network to try and take which gateways are faster and which are
slower into account.

The second question is, what will OLSRv2 get you which will make this
work better? Now, I don't think that OLSRv2 actually has the
SmartGateway support described above ported to the new codebase yet
(though I'm not certain). However, what it does have is a better method
of choosing routes. OLSRv1 uses the ETX metric for deciding which links
to use in the network; ETX is basically just a measure of packet loss.
However, OLSRv2 by default uses an updated metric called ETT. ETT uses
not just packet loss, but link capacity as reported by the radio to
choose routes. ETT would, for instance, conceivably choose a 54Mbps link
with 10% packet loss over a 2Mbps link with 5% packet loss. So it won't
take faster gateways into account on its own, but it will more
accurately choose which gateway you have the best connection to.

The third question is, can you use more than one gateway at once in
order to multiplex uplink capacity? This question is a little more
complicated. The newest versions of SmartGateway (now dubbed
MultiSmartGateway) contain support for using multiple gateways at once.
However, to my understanding, this is designed to work in tandem with
another protocol called BRDP (Border Router Discovery Protocol). BRDP
basically sends information that allows each node to replace its default
route with a statistical table of available default routes.
Unfortunately, as far as I know, no practical implementation of BRDP yet
exists. If it ever does, however, OLSR is already set up to work with it
and would allow for multiple gateways to be used in tandem for a single
connection, dramatically increasing uplink capacity. This is an advanced
application of this capability, and would also need a network with full
IPv6 support as well as multi-path transport protocols like MP-TCP in
order to fully realize it. Also, without communicating to a host on the
internet that is also set up to make best use of it, this applies mostly
to the uplink and not the downlink; there isn't anything in standard
TCP/IP that makes a host aware of multiple return paths.

Anyway, sorry for the overly long explanation. The upshot is that
depending on what you want to do, some stuff is ready to go with OLSRv1
even if we don't turn it on by default, but other stuff may be a longer
way off than just upgrading to OLSRv2.

josh,
thanks for the explanation. a little above my pay grade but I think I understand.  Interesting stuff.
If I can figure out how to, maybe I'll experiment with the options in OLSRv1.  However, what I'm probably looking for is dynamic gateway selection or possibly what you call multiplex uplink capacity.  Those sound complicated and not likely to be implemented in the near future.
thanks again,
john

josh,

	Following up on the scenario you describe in the paragraph copied below, I tracked down the OLSR setting for upstream and downstream speed.  Can you point me in the direction of the setting(s) to "set every other node in the network to take that into account when choosing a gateway"?
I assume it's on the OLSR Daemon page but I'm not finding anything obvious.  
thanks,

Hey John, Dan,

No problem! SmartGateway has the following configuration parameters
pertaining to weighting by bandwidth:

SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkUp (controls whether to consider upload
bandwidth in gateway selection, default is 1)
SmartGatewayWeightExitLinkDown (controls whether to consider download
bandwidth in gateway selection, default is 1)
SmartGatewayWeightEtx (controls whether to consider ETX in gateway
selection, default is (obviously) 1)
SmartGatewayDividerEtx (controls how bandwidth and ETX are compared,
default is 0)

The recommended settings in the README suggest leaving the first 3
settings at one, and setting SmartGatewayDividerEtx to 4096 (if it's set
to zero, as it is by default, bandwidth is not taken into account and
only ETX is used). The README contains the formula for the calculation:

http://olsr.org/git/?p=olsrd.git;a=blob_plain;f=README-Olsr-Extensions;hb=HEAD

In general, the READMEs in the OLSRd git repository, both for the daemon
itself and for its plugins, are the best source of documentation for
specific configuration settings. OLSRd has been around for along while,
and thus a lot of other documentation you find around the internet is
out of date.

So using this knowledge, you'd set the upstream and downstream speed in
the OLSRd configuration file on your gateway node, and then configure
every other node in the network with SmartGatewayDividerEtx, which will
force OLSRd to take those bandwidth values into account. I haven't
tested this myself though, as we don't currently have an automated way
built into Commotion to test those values.

Hi Luigi, my responses to some of your questions are inline:

An understandable concern, for sure. I can say that OTI has every
intention to continue developing Commotion and supporting the people
and communities that use it in the capacity that we're able. We're
always limited by our funding and other commitments, but we're
continuing to search out new opportunities to increase our capacity to
evolve the platform. I certainly am committed to developing Commotion
as long as possible :)

As for modifying Commotion itself, it depends on what you'd like to
modify or change about it. Modifying the web interface, which is what
most users will interact with, requires knowledge of basic web design
(HTML, CSS, some javascript) and OpenWRT's LuCI framework
(http://luci.subsignal.org/) which is built in Lua.

Anything more substantial than that, I would recommend learning about
the internals of OpenWRT, which has substantial (though sometimes
outdated) documentation: http://wiki.openwrt.org/. For the
Commotion-specific components, you can check out the code on Github
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute) and documentation
(http://wiki.commotionwireless.net/).

Developing applications is much more open. Any applications you can
run over the internet or on a LAN can run on a Commotion network.
Websites, file-sharing, streaming radio, game servers, you name it.
Web applications (like MediaGrid) are probably the most common. As
long as you have a server connected to the mesh that has some sort of
application running, you can announce it using the Commotion apps
portal:
http://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Application_Portal.

The largest deployed Commotion networks are in the US (Detroit and Red
Hook) and Tunisia (Sayada), and they would be good people to ask for
advice. Some of them are hopefully on this email list, which we're
encouraging to be a place for users and network builders to share
their experiences, and more info can be found here:
https://commotionwireless.net/about/where-its-used/.

I'm afraid I don't know the plans for the next IS4CWN. But if we ever
have the opportunity to go to Italy and meet you all, that would be great!

cheers,
Dan

Message-ID: <CACvMzF0BT5+2=rDef-yFMi+RHuGSKKVk5kXFK6-0Z8T7Wnqnmw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,
   I have a really important meeting today where I was hoping to Demo some
of the Ubiquiti routers I have running Commotion.  I have a Bullet, Pico
and Nano of which all were flashed with Commotion Developer Release 2 dr2.
 I wanted to upgrade today before the demo, however I'm having the same
problem on all devices where I can't get past a certain point on the
configuration page.
  I'm able to pull up the landing page easily by looking up the DHCP ip
address on my home router (which is running Advanced Tomato).  Typing the
ip address in the URL brings me to the Luci admin screen from which the
only link that seems to work is "Local Applications".  I managed to get
into the Admin sign-in by inputing the ------/cgi-bin/luci/admin address
manually and eliminating the last backslash.  From here I'm able to login
using my password and it brings me to the Configuration dialog.  I can save
and apply using the dialog but anything else just seems to time out.  Even
when I try the manual URL method as before.  Any idea whats going wrong?
 As I mentioned before, I have them connected to my router which is running
Advanced Tomato and may have some custom settings tripping it up somewhere.
 Still its strange that it lets me get this far but no further...  On the
other hand, if anyone is familiar with Tomato, its possible I may be able
to tweak something on the router end if that turns out to be the issue.
   Otherwise, can anybody point me to the most recent instructions for
resetting via TFTP?

Hi Andrew!

I think the most up to date instructions are here:
https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/installing-configuring/install-and-recover-tftp/

You might also try following the Commotion 1.1 Upgrade guide that's here on
the wiki:
https://wiki.commotionwireless.net/doku.php/general_resources/documentation/router/upgrading_from_previous_versions

Let us know if that helps!

-Georgia

Hi Andrew,

These are all running DR2, right? You haven't upgraded them to version 1
yet?

The first thing that comes to mind is that it's a firewall issue. When a
Commotion router gets a DHCP lease for its ethernet interface from an
upstream router, it treats any connections over ethernet as coming from
the unsafe "wan" zone. Therefore, there is a firewall rule blocking
connections to the HTTPS admin web interface (though HTTP and SSH are
allowed).

To get around this, you could connect to the router's access point and
freely use the admin web interface, or you could, over ethernet, SSH
into the node and temporarily turn off the firewall with
`/etc/init.d/firewall stop` (or just add a firewall opening for port 443
in /etc/config/firewall and restart the firewall).

Hey Andrew!

Not sure why you're getting that error. I would recommend reflashing
all the routers to Version 1.1 , which you can find here:
https://commotionwireless.net/download/routers/

PLEASE NOTE: if you install Version 1.1 it will not be compatible with
other routers running DR2. You would have to reflash all three in
order to get them to mesh.

We will hopefully be releasing the latest version today with some more
bugfixes, but the one currently on the site will work fine for your demo.

Also, here are the TFTP recovery instructions:
https://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/installing-configuring/install-and-recover-tftp/

Let me know if you have any questions about the recovery process,
we're happy to help!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion Router v1.1.rc2 released!
Message-ID: <539F061F.7080208@opentechinstitute.org>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that we've just posted the second release
candidate for the stable 1.1 version of the Commotion Router firmware.
This version patches a memory leak in our Serval plugin, and also
includes a number of small bugfixes and interface tweaks. You can find
the release notes here:

https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/06/13/commotion-router-1.1rc2-release-notes/

and downloads here:

https://commotionwireless.net/download/routers/

We currently have images for a selection of Ubiquiti routers posted, and
will be posting images for select TP-Link and Buffalo routers shortly.
Pending completion of testing on one of our larger community testbed
networks, this release will hopefully become v1.1 final within the next
week or two.

Hey Luigi,

Since we have had some conversation off the list, I wanted to bring it  
back to the list....

As far as the initial steps of the networks--I think it varies quiet a  
bit. In Tunisia, the initial network was build over 4 days in a large  
community workshop that had about 10-15 core people and 20-30  
additional participants.  In that workshop they talked about what they  
wanted the network to do, where it would connect, etc. During the  
workshop the participants went through several of the Commotion  
Construction Kit activities (like http://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/) 
. The group made a map of where they wanted to connect with the  
network and of rooftops they might have access to. I think a few core  
people is great, but a larger community meeting is important for  
getting more people involved and donate their rooftops.

In other places the process has been over a longer time frame, and  
groups will do one or two activities a week together. If you guys  
wanted to go that direction, I'd be happy to make some suggestions  
about how that could be structured. I'm sure others on the list would  
also have suggestions.

If you do go through the Commotion activities we would love to get  
pictures and blog about it.

Other community technology projects have been launched using a  
DiscoTech model, which is a fun way a community can engage with new  
technologies:
http://detroitdjc.org/2012/07/01/discotech-zine-out-now/

We also recently made a Digital Stewards facebook group, which will  
hopefully be a good resource on all the community network and digital  
stewardship projects: https://www.facebook.com/DigitalStewards?fref=nf

In terms of commitment to Commotion, I think the good thing about open  
source router firmware is that you arent locked into a single firmware  
or hardware. As new versions of openwrt mesh come out--you can try  
those too.

If you'd like help going through the installation process, I'm sure  
people would be willing to jump on a video call to do it together....

Cheers!
Ryan

Hello Again,
   So my meeting went well enough for me to start sharing some details
about our potential deployment in coastal Maine.  I have a lot of technical
questions that I'll post in a different thread, but I'll try to give some
background in this post.
   As the Co-Captain of Code for Maine, an affiliate of the Code for
America Brigade in Maine, I've found the potential for civic hacking in
rural regions is often blocked by a lack of adequate wireless
infrastructure.  I first encountered this problem when attempting to design
a low-cost, open source vehicle tracker
<http://www.openvehicletracker.org> for small
transit systems and municipal vehicle fleets such as snow plows.  3G
networks presented enormous problems, partially due to the wireless
carriers, but mostly because coverage in rural places is far from reliable.
 This is especially true in my current place of residence in South
Harpswell Maine, which is more or less a collection of long narrow
peninsulas extending deep into Casco Bay north of Portland.  Much of the
area, including the fire station, school and post office have no cell
coverage whatsoever.  As counter-intuitive as it may seem, Mesh Networking
emerged as a viable alternative for tracking public sector vehicle fleets
since nearly all use cases were confined to a fixed route or at least a
well-defined service area.  Network connections can therefore be planned in
advanced by setting up fixed node locations where needed.  Of course, this
would involve a good deal of field work and logistics, but this is where
working in a small town can be an advantage over a larger city where
obtaining the necessary approvals may require years of sustained effort.
 In a small town, it could be as simple as submitting a motion at town
meeting.
   At least, that was the theory when we first explored the issue over two
years ago.  Since then, we've discovered the Commotion Project, started
working closely with the local Harpswell Middle School, and expanded the
focus from vehicle tracking to include environmental monitoring, mapping,
and field data collection.  We managed to get a hold of three Ubiquiti
Routers, and flashed them with a (now deprecated) version of Commotion.
 The hard part came down to finding a site with decent elevation...
  Well now it seems that we've not only found a site, but a potential
partner in the form of the local Community Broadcasting Network!
   Long story short...  The same people who run the community library also
run the Harpswell Community Broadcasting station
<http://www.harpswelltv.org/>.  I mentioned to the station director (who
also serves as town selectman and State Rep.) that we've been looking for a
spot to setup a community wireless network and he immediately replied that
they've been looking to preserve a water tower that was left to the town
when the Navy closed down an old fuel depot.  The water tower is quite
possibly the highest point in the entire town, and situated in the very
center of a peninsula it would have line-of-site for nearly 360 degrees
including a big chunk of Casco Bay as far as Portland!  I attached a .kmz
file showing the towers location and relative elevation in case its
possible to get a line-of-site estimate based on frequency and elevation.
  The tower is also located in the middle of a park created when the Navy
left the Fuel Depot, and it is immediately behind the town fire station.
 Apparently, the town has been looking for possible uses to justify
investing in the upkeep of its structural integrity.  I mentioned to them
that part of the point of CW is to minimize infrastructural requirements,
but it does open up a whole range of possible applications.  From weather
stations, to webcams, to AIS receivers...

  Nevertheless, I made sure they understood that the project does not
necessarily need a water tower to be effective, and even if the town votes
to demolish, the real opportunity in my view, lies in the potential to
forge partnerships within the frameworks of local community broadcasting.
 Especially in the case of Harpswell as they're one of the few public
access stations who actually transmit their own signal (as opposed to
running a community bulletin board through the local Cable Provider).  For
one thing, there's probably nobody more knowledgable about how local
geography impacts broadcast frequencies etc...  But most importantly in the
case of Maine, the community broadcasters have been leading the fight to
defend public airwaves from monopolization, and anyone involved seems to be
an expert in FCC regulatory law.  While I can claim no such knowledge, the
community wireless movement appears to be a natural evolution of the same
local institutions.

  So thats where we stand at present and things finally look to be coming
together, Besides the more technical questions I will comment on
separately, I had some general questions concerning range testing and
community broadcasting frameworks.  Are there any tools or formulas
available to help estimate what the possible range of a Ubiquity Bullet set
up on the watertower would be?  The attached .kmz file should include the
precise geocoordinates and sea-level elevation and I estimate that the
tower is another 36 meters above ground level.  You can also clearly see
the tower from Google street view if anyone wants to take a look.  It would
be great if I could put together a visual approximation of what we could
reach from the water tower vs. another location.
   Also, are there any other use-cases where Community TV-Radio has
embraced WiFi within their existing framework?  What are some possibilities
for further collaboration?  I've mentioned the exciting work being done in
the field of Software Defined Radio and the RTL-SDR
<http://www.rtl-sdr.com/> hacks.  How could we use low-cost, open source
tools to combine the knowledge of the analog radio community (HAM Radio,
public access etc...) with the civic hacking community?

Hello Ryan,
thanks to you to consider this.
I want to take this opportunity to give an update of where we are with our project.
One of the major rappresentative of a charity association , who understand the potential of mesh networks for local community,has decided to fund the activity for the installation of the first two Commotion nodes in Fano.I have already submitted the budget(very helpful the post on Commotion blog) for the start-up and current expenses.
This evening,our small team(fours member) will meet him in order to define all the objectives  and  check all the needed competences(some competences,like software development can be missing) .
The main objective is to define a platform(the Commotion wireless network and some applications) to collect and share the data related to the activity of the charity association.
For example, the list of all the goods available and the goods missing.The addresses and phone numbers of the persons who have been supported by the association:divorced women and men,people who have lost the job,people who cannot pay for the gas electricity bill.....
Furthermore,we want to make available a local blog where the local community can share ideas and opinions and in parallel give the possibility,through the same network,to have the access to Internet.
>From a technical point of view I have verified that all these features  can be implemented using Commotion software.
We will keep updated through the digital stuart Facebook page when the first installation will be done,with all the pictures and comments.
Of course if we need you support we will contact you.
To close this long letter,I want to share with you also the possibility we are evaluating,to have funds from European Community for activity who improve the social integration  and social improvements.
Could be interesting to know if we can cooperate on this and share ideas with you and our friends in of Mesh Sayada Community in Tunisia.

Ciao!!

luigi

Hey Luigi,

Since we have had some conversation off the list, I wanted to bring it  
back to the list....

As far as the initial steps of the networks--I think it varies quiet a  
bit. In Tunisia, the initial network was build over 4 days in a large  
community workshop that had about 10-15 core people and 20-30  
additional participants.  In that workshop they talked about what they  
wanted the network to do, where it would connect, etc. During the  
workshop the participants went through several of the Commotion  
Construction Kit activities (like http://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/planning/design-your-network-every-network-tells-story/) 
. The group made a map of where they wanted to connect with the  
network and of rooftops they might have access to. I think a few core  
people is great, but a larger community meeting is important for  
getting more people involved and donate their rooftops.

In other places the process has been over a longer time frame, and  
groups will do one or two activities a week together. If you guys  
wanted to go that direction, I'd be happy to make some suggestions  
about how that could be structured. I'm sure others on the list would  
also have suggestions.

If you do go through the Commotion activities we would love to get  
pictures and blog about it.

Other community technology projects have been launched using a  
DiscoTech model, which is a fun way a community can engage with new  
technologies:
http://detroitdjc.org/2012/07/01/discotech-zine-out-now/

We also recently made a Digital Stewards facebook group, which will  
hopefully be a good resource on all the community network and digital  
stewardship projects: https://www.facebook.com/DigitalStewards?fref=nf

In terms of commitment to Commotion, I think the good thing about open  
source router firmware is that you arent locked into a single firmware  
or hardware. As new versions of openwrt mesh come out--you can try  
those too.

If you'd like help going through the installation process, I'm sure  
people would be willing to jump on a video call to do it together....

Cheers!
Ryan

In Red Hook we have created a technology training program to teach young
adults how to install, maintain and promote our community network. We do
much more than that as well, giving the young persons broad tech exposure
and skills, (workplace tech, networking, google apps, etc), media
production skills (video production, graphic design, web design, social
media strategy and app design), community projects and internships. This
builds the capacity to maintain the network and other technology
initiatives in our neighborhood, and launches these young people into tech
careers. I am happy to share insights and materials with you if you are
interested.
Welcome, and good luck!
tony

Hi Andrew,

It sounds like you have a lot of great opportunities and resources in
your area! And that water tower sounds like the perfect place to be a
connecting point for nodes in the area.

As far as the Ubiquiti bullet goes, it's a very powerful radio (up to
6-7 watts), and you can attach a high-gain external antenna, either
directional or omni. Since the water tower is at a high elevation, it
might make more sense to put more than one bullet on there with
directional antennas covering slices of the area. But that's a better
question for a wireless/radio engineer, like maybe someone involved in
the radio broadcasting in your town. I'm also CCing Andy Gunn, who has
lots of knowledge in that area.

As for use cases where community radio/TV has worked with WiFi, I'm
going to have to defer to others who know more about that than I do.

Please keep us updated on your efforts!

Dan

Hey Andrew (and Dan) - a few thoughts on this, below.

First - the Ubiquiti Bullet and PicoStation units share similar
hardware, but are only 28dBm output (for 2.4GHz band), so it is about
640mW (0.64 watts), not a full 6 watts. That would be over the FCC spec!

I would also always recommend going with MIMO (multiple input, multiple
output) devices these days. Bullets and PicoStations are single-stream
devices, which limits their throughput. In addition, MIMO devices are
somewhat more resilient to interference and actually benefit from
multipath (signal reflections).

For your use case of fleet tracking, I think it makes sense to use a
900MHz system rather than 2.4GHz or 5GHz. 900MHz (and lower) is much
less reliant on line-of-sight connections.

Ubiquiti does make both a NanoStation Loco M900 and Rocket M9, with a
few antennas for the latter. They will be slightly more expensive than
the 2.4GHz equipment, but may work better in your scenario. These would
be what I would recommend for your base station on the water tower.

http://www.microcom.us/rocketm9.html
http://www.microcom.us/am9m13.html

For the mobile stations, I think you would need to make more of a custom
solution. A MicroTik board with a 900MHz mini-PCI card would work, and
can use any sort of 900MHz whip antenna for a vehicle.

Disclaimer: To do this with non-2.4GHz or 5GHz equipment, you will need
to build custom Commotion images or modify existing configurations, as
we haven't tested the software with 900MHz devices. The wireless
configurations will need to be changed for that before installation, as
the setup wizard will choke on the 900MHz radios, I think.

That's correct.

It should be a relatively easy addition to the luci.commotion.network
module
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute/luci-commotion/blob/master/modules/network.lua),
but I've never tested a 900MHz device to confirm.

Hello everyone,

I just started setting up the mesh and I am having some trouble with the
wireless settings.  It is working at defaults on 2.4 Ghz on Ch 11, but
whenever I try to change it to anything else and save it, I get the
following error.

/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:448: Failed to execute cbi dispatcher
target for entry '/admin/commotion/basic/wireless_network'.
The called action terminated with an exception:
/usr/lib/lua/luci/cbi.lua:457: bad argument #4 to 'set' (string expected,
got nil)

Thanks for any insight.

Hi Mike,

Did you download your router image from the commotion site or build it
from source?

It looks like the TP Link images haven't been updating, so if you're
using a downloaded image you may be seeing a bug that's already been fixed.

This is a problem with the Commotion site, so you may not find what
you're looking for. The nightly images for TL-WDR4300 are definitely too
old. You might try the old 1.1rc1 image
(http://downloads.commotionwireless.net/router/1.1rc1/ar71xx/generic/),
but that may or may not have the bugfix you need.

Your best options are either to build from source
(https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotion-router) or wait for the
correct images to be uploaded to the commotion site.

Nice idea. Should be better suited for disaster communication than WiF
because of the range and a separate battery. Make it a bit cheaper and
it would be a no brainer to buy for outdoor activities as well.

This seems like it might be a preferable alternative to previous wifi
technologies used in the Bridge, for a few reasons -- looks like it
could be easy to set up and manage private/public division in your
network, in a way that is actually in compliance with regulation in the
US.

It's a cool project. I had a chat with their lead developer a few months
ago, to see if there were any areas of possible collaboration.
Unfortunately there's not a lot of overlap between the goals of Open
Wireless and Commotion. However, some similarities include security and
an interest in Quality of Service controls so folks can share only a
portion of their bandwidth with the network.

I'd love to flash it on a router and try it out.

Yes - though I find their claims on the range a bit dubious, I'm
assuming it uses 900MHz so should get _some_ decent range.

Probably worth trying out once it is available, I'm not sure I'm excited
enough to pre-order.

It uses 150MHz, thus the ranges.

Ah very interesting. MURS is one of those bands I need to learn more
about - the propagation makes more sense now.

I couldn't tell from their site if these routers mesh with each other or
not.

   - Babel mesh routing protocol (source specific routing release).

from: https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/cerowrt


it seems to be a very promising project based on openwrt distribution

Although CeroWRT contains Babel, the Open Wireless firmware from EFF
does not do mesh networking. It's still a great project though...not
everything needs to mesh :)

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Local applications for your networks?
Message-ID: <53D11745.9000001@opentechinstitute.org>

Hi network builders - I have a question for you all. We are planning on
putting together a listing of applications that would or could work well
as locally hosted services for community networks - i.e. chat servers,
file servers, blog platforms, etc.

What local applications are you using on your networks now? If you
aren't using any, are there applications you have looked into and / or
are interesting? Do you know if these can be hosted locally?

For instance:
* MediaGrid [1] - chat and file sharing
* Kiwix [2] - offline or locally hosted Wikipedia

Just compiling a list for now, thanks for all your help and input!
-Andy

our "local" applications are actually web applications. Collecting Stop and

I would very, very much like to hear about local application options.

First, This has not been covered in the listserv before. There are only
some config files relating to zabbix that have been discussed.

The bigger problem is that it looks like lists.chambana.net listservs
have been removed from a variety of search engines (google & duckduckgo
included.) This means that there is no accessable way to search the
archives currently.

The only search that I found that indexed it still was ixquick. But,
they last indexed the listservs in 2012.

We should add an on-site search option for the lists until we get this
figured out. Does mailman 2  have search built in?

Anthony,

I should also point out that that last message is completely useless at
solving your actual problem. Sorry!

I don't know zabbix, just listservs. :)

Hey Anderson - my colleague Ryan reminded me about QoS on the Ubiquiti
devices, and how we have discussed that it isn't necessarily the best idea.

The problem with Ubiquiti devices is that they don't have a large amount
of memory to store the data for QoS, so as traffic gets heavier,
performance can take a big hit. This is just a guess, but I wouldn't
enable QoS in OpenWRT or Commotion on any device that has less than 64MB
of RAM (not flash). Just for reference, the Ubiquiti PicoStation M and
NanoStation M routers we have used for building our test networks have
only 32MB of RAM. Ubiquiti Rocket M series devices have 64MB of RAM though.

As we work towards supporting more router models, QoS performance
impacts will be something worth testing.

I wanted to mention this on the list (and I believe others have
mentioned it in the past - Ben I'm looking in your direction), and ask
what QoS or rate limiting folks are doing on their networks, and how
well does your solution work?

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Remote site, solar-battery data logger.
Message-ID: <CAEqQJe0865NCn-aOUX8z0QQWMDx+KQzD7+AcGOKNgmURPXpbEQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm thinking about setting up some high vantage point routers that are
operated by a solar panel and some small SLA or lithium batteries. I have
been looking around for low cost solar chargers that incorporate "smart
charging" capabilities combined with data logging and network-ability.

Does anyone know of any small, low cost, weatherproof solar chargers that
can charge a single sealed lead acid battery, lithium ion, or similar
battery? Something that also incorporates a small data logging memory that
can be accessed and visualized remotely over a network connection?
Something that is HTML so it can be viewed in a webpage on any platform?
Maybe even email alerts to alert when the system requires maintenance?

Like I said, the routers would be located in difficult to reach and remote
locations and should be stand alone and off the grid. I need a way to keep
an eye on the system without being physically present unless absolutely
necessary. Ideally the only malfunction that should occur would be a
failing battery and would need to be continuously monitored for the
continued safety and security of the community.

I'd like to avoid building my own chargers unless there is no commercially
viable and inexpensive solution.

Any comments, thoughts, suggestions?

thanks,
Jared

My recommendation, from operating a mesh network with firmware very similar
to Commotion, that serves ~100 people daily, would be to focus on how many
mesh nodes you would need to deploy.  Likewise, since there is no way to
fit 2000 users on a single 2.4GHz channel, you would be needing to segment
such a large deployment into pocket meshes, e.g. a handful of nodes in each
mesh, with adjacent meshes programmed to non-overlapping channels.
Backhaul between these pocket meshes could be done with 5.8GHz radios, or
wired backhaul depending on your situation.

To help with estimating how many nodes you'd need, it's fair to assume each
node could only support up to 5 (or possibly 10) simultaneous clients
before either the node itself exhausts its RAM (only 32Mbytes onboard
memory) or before the particular channel used by that ( node + its
neighboring nodes + all clients ) becomes saturated.

Hi Ben,

Thank you for your feedback. We will review our overall deployment design.

Here is some additional information. We will build a customized node. The
prototype is using a dual core ARM cpu with 2GB ram, gigabyte Ethernet as wired
backhaul. We will hookup USB WiFi dongle to service the clients.

We do plan to test wireless backhaul and probably run it on 5.8GHz radios.

Right now the design call for each node to support 30 to 50 clients. We
will try to find out what kind of usage scenario is possible. Data only?
with voice? with video? How will transfer large data affect the performance?

Cheers,
Paul

If it is necessary, we can use quad cores or 8 cores ARM CPU.

Wow, that would be a lot of CPU and RAM behind a single 802.11n radio.
Given at host machine with that many resources, I think you may find the
USB dongle itself becoming a bottleneck far before the host CPU sees any
significant load.  The USB protocol stack itself (e.g. the ath9k_htc
driver) is going to impose limitations on throughput in and out of the
dongle, likely to be far less than the USB link speed.  Embedded nodes use
faster bus interfaces such like mini-PCI for this reason.

Also, you would be sacrificing some channel capacity if your USB dongle has
only 1 RP-SMA port (making 2x2 MIMO unavailable), or if it uses itty bitty
internal patch antennae.

For a node capable of hosting 30-50 clients, here is an ARM9-based single
board computer, with a mini-PCI slot:
http://www.gateworks.com/product/item/laguna-gw2388-4-network-processor

Likewise, here is a mini-PCI 802.11n radio from UBNT.  Two coaxial jacks
for antenna diversity:
http://shop.bizsyscon.com/ubiquiti-sr71-12-mimo-802-11b-g-n-2ghz-mini-pci/

This bug ticket does suggest at least one person has met moderate success
running both of these units together under OpenWRT:
https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/13465

Also, there should be other options for single board computer  + mini-PCI
with OpenWRT support out there, if that is your host OS of choice.

Hi Ben,

Thanks for the suggestion. I will check them out. I do like to ask your
opinion about the following:

Several new ARM boards with 8 cores that is coming out have USB 3.0
build-in. On-board memory will start from 2GB and some might have 4GB. Do
you think USB 3.0 WiFi dongle with 8 core ARM board might provide good
performance?

We will get some WiFi dongle with big antenna or modify it and graft some
big antenna onto it.

Driver might be an issue. We do not know until we have the board and WiFi
dongle to run some test.

Paul

Hi Paul, likely the USB driver will remain a potential bottleneck, as your
USB dongle itself will presumably only talk at USB 2.0 speeds and not
utilize 3.0 anyway.  You would need a dongle that is advertised at USB 3.0
compliant, and which has robust linux / OpenWRT support.  My guess is that
mini-PCI would probably offer better options for adequate bus speed +
sufficient driver support.

Dear Ben,

The reason that we consider these new ARM boards and USB 3.0 WiFi dongle
because they are cheap and we might be able to use 802.11ac as backhaul. We
are very cost driven but we want to get the best performance that we can
get.

Paul

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] LED programming for mesh status?
Message-ID: <536FE1A0.70000@wisc.edu>

under "System" is an option called: "LED Configuration"
I have Ubiquiti picostation  m2hp units that have multiple LEDs.
Ive figured out how to turn the LEDs on and off but would like to have one turn on only when the picostation is meshed with other stations on the mesh.
Alternatively I'd like to have one of the LEDs turn on when there is access to the internet.
Is there an available trigger that would do either one of these?
To be honest I'm pretty ignorant of network programming so the listed triggers don't mean much to me.
thanks,
john

Hey Jon,

I think all of these would require a custom led script. The
documentation for all the available scripts can be found here.

http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/system#leds

The scripts themselves are written in C from what I can tell. Here is
the list of all the current scripts source code before they are compiled.

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/plain/drivers/leds/trigger/

I hope this helps.

That sounds like a tall order :)

I've had little experience with solar powered tech, but from what I have
worked with and seen, there isn't any sort of all-in-one package like
the kind of thing you describe. Folks I've seen that have rigged up
solar panels and batteries to routers and the like have had pretty DIY
setups.

One person who I would suggest talking to is Danny Iland
(http://www.dannyiland.com/). He does solar-powered wifi router stuff,
which he demoed at last year's Int'l Summit for Community Wireless Networks.

Hi Jared - just to follow up on Dan's message, I think you will probably
have to use a few products to accomplish this task, or plan on spending
quite a bit for a higher-end charge controller.

Just a note: I'm not a solar expert, but I did do a stint as an
electrician, working on solar installations along with the usual
residential stuff. I am more of an expert on remote monitoring,
instrumentation and control from my time working in radio, where remote
control of distant transmitter sites is a must.

That said, I was able to find a charge controller from a company I have
actually heard of that has Ethernet access and some semblance of control
over the web. Note: I have not used this controller before, so I can't
speak to it's features:
http://www.midnitesolar.com/productPhoto.php?product_ID=331&productCatName=Charge%20Controllers%20-%20Classics&productCat_ID=21&sortOrder=5&act=p

Obviously, it's not cheap, so that doesn't fit your low cost need. My
suggestion is to use an off-the-shelf charge controller, and combine it
with a remote monitoring sensor or remote control unit that you can
program to monitor voltages, temperatures and use internal relays to
reboot or disconnect equipment.

Some examples of lower cost PWM charge controllers are here:
http://www.solar-electric.com/stpwmchco.html
(Though PWM are not the most efficient charge controllers, they are
lower cost)

A company called Control By Web has a series of very good remote control
units with web interfaces:
http://www.controlbyweb.com/products.html

While they are not exactly cheap, they are robust and some have multiple
features. They are also small, DIN rail mountable, and low power. My
recommendation is the X-320, though it might be overkill:
http://www.controlbyweb.com/x320/

If you have more time on yours hands, something like an Arduino or
Raspberry Pi can be set up to take in voltages or sensor data on the
analog inputs, control external relays, and is fully programmable. I'm
not an expert with those, so I am only speculating, but I think would be
able to serve your purpose very well.

Sorry I don't have a magic bullet, but I'm hoping someone out there is
working on one!

Hi Jon - just a quick follow up to Seamus' earlier e-mail, there is a
way to set up something close to what you want for showing when a router
is meshed. I'm not sure how to indicate that a router has a gateway
connection in a simple way, it seems like the scripts Seamus mentions
might be the only way.

If you go to the menu that you indicated, and add an LED state:
1. Select the LED you want, "ubnt:red:link:1" for instance for the red
light.
2. Select the "netdev" trigger
3. Select the device "wlan0-1" for the mesh interface
4. Select "transmit" or "receive" as the trigger mode.

Repeat for the other trigger mode, so you have both transmit and receive
tied to separate LEDs (say orange and red, or orange and another green
light).

Save and apply. You should see the light flash for traffic in the
particular direction indicated (received or transmitted), which can
indicate mesh traffic. If it isn't meshing, you will see no traffic!

I know it isn't exactly what you were looking for, but it can be helpful
for seeing the mesh in action.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] seeking input - what additional routers should
	Commotion support?
Message-ID: <53736499.5050001@opentechinstitute.org>

Hello! The Commotion team is working on expanding support for additional
router models and would love to hear from the community on this list
about what routers you're using or would like to use with Commotion.

I've put together a summary blog post with more info:
http://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/05/13/little-box-of-routers/

With our upcoming point release (Commotion Router 1.1), we'll be adding
supported images for several routers:

- TP Link WDR4300
- Mikrotik RB411AH
- Buffalo G300NH
- Buffalo AG300N

In general, Commotion Router has these system requirements:

- Wireless chipset (target) is ar71xx or atheros
- The router has greater than 4MB of flash
(4MB is recommended for optimal support - we're working on images for
the many routers with 4MB of flash memory)
- The router supports OpenWRT 10.x Attitude Adjustment or greater

We’ve compiled a list of potentially compatible routers on our wiki as a
guide
(https://wiki.commotionwireless.net/doku.php?id=development_resources:router:hardware_compatibility_list)


But we'd also like to hear from you to help focus our list to support
hardware that's available in your area. We'd particularly like to hear
from folks who are not in the US.

If you are interested in helping out and have one or more of the routers
on our list, contact us! We’ll even build a testing image for you if
your device is compatible!

There are a handful of products now sold, similar in form factor to the
small TP-Link routers, with affinity to mesh networks.  They're all quite
OpenWRT friendly, so adding Commotion support could be as simple as adding
another target to the buildbot's runlist.

Mesh Potato v2
http://store.villagetelco.com/mesh-potatoes/mesh-potato-2-basic.html

GL-iNet v1 (this just recently appeared)
http://www.gl-inet.com/w/?page_id=308&lang=en
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JL2AOXQ?ie=UTF8&seller=A364119SDJA4QG&sn=alzhao(8MB
flash)
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKFE0FW?ie=UTF8&seller=A364119SDJA4QG&sn=alzhao(16MB
flash)

There is also an upcoming product from Nubelium in Spain that looks near
identical to the Mesh Potato v2:
https://twitter.com/nubelium/media

Likewise Serval's Mesh Extender device:
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/speak-freely

P.S. I have Attitude Adjustment running with USB on a TP-Link TL3420 v2,
too.  Still not doing anything useful with pivot root, tho.

Thanks for these suggestions, Ben.

Another list member also replied privately, suggesting the TP-LINK
WDR3600, which is the same build target as the WDR4300 and WDR4310.

So far, my hardware order list is below. It would be great to hear from
other folks, either on-list or private messaging.

Hello Josh and Dan,
I contact directly you because I have already contacted you in the past.
I have talk to Josh and Dan in Berlin at IS4WCN 2013.

I have spent a lot of effort to perform tests Commotion Wireless 
firmaware and
I think you(all the team) did a great job.
The test has been done, until now, in my Home, with 2 picostations,2
raspberry,1 nanostation,several PCs,smartphone...
But much more effort has been spent  to create a community and spread around
the idea of your project.
This has been much more difficult that the technical evaluation of the 
firmware.
I am ,now,at a point where the idea has very good chances to be realized.
In the last few weeks I have constituted a team( 3 young boys(18/19
years old), 1 adult and me).
I don't bother you on how much effort it took to achieve 
this:time,meeting,money,advertisements,for months and months.
I have already showed to team how the commotion wireless mesh works and 
I have used MediaGrid installed on a mini server (raspberry).
The outcome of this?
The boys have bought the Raspberry by their own and have created a 
facebook page:

https://www.facebook.com/pages/Commotion-Wireless-Fano/138757409627896?notif_t=page_invite_accepted 


(See the picture with all of you!)
But more important achievement is that a community representative of the 
local church contacted me saying that he wants to support the project.
This is a great start,because ,soon lot of people in the city will talk 
about this project and you.
I have called this approach "Internet at Km 0" where,with this, I mean 
that the data and the network are used  by the local community who 
created them and therefore own them.
Like goods locally produced are consumed locally, the same for the data 
and internet.
I have learned a lot from you and this is the key point I have got form 
your experience.
But I have talked a lot and I go directly to the point.
Few questions.
a)I'm going to invest in Commotion Wireless :How long the 
CommotionWireless project will be supported by you(OTI,)?
I would like to avoid that I start with your solution and after 1 year 
all will be shutted down.
b)I need to understand better which effort has to be done to be in the
condition to modify commotion software and develop specific applications
for the community.This will not done tomorrow,but I want to create some
local competencies for developing applications and support software
development .We need to go by our legs.
In other words:how did you reach the competences you have now?
Which are your suggestions?
c)For planning and installing the network I need really your support.
I can follow the guidelines on Commotion web site "Get started".
But it is save to have the final approval from who has already 
implemented successfully the network several time.
I saw the second Commotion node installed by Dan in Baltimore!
d)Where the IS4WCN will be in Europe on 2014?Can you take this 
opportunity and come in Italy and meet us and the new"Italian Digital
Stuart"?

Thanks a lot to all of you.
Waiting for your reply.

Luigi

I'm very interested in the MeshPotato v2. Steve Song said he'd hook us
up with some last year but that never materialized, probably because it
was still in development. I'm especially interested in them because they
include an analog telephony adapter.

I asked this of a friend of mine who does rooftop solar installations for
large institutional clients.  The cheapest stand-alone datalogger with IP
access that he knew of would ring in at the $350 range, i.e. half the cost
of the X-320 product, but still rather pricey.

He did agree that using an inexpensive embedded computer like an rPI or
Arduino would be a better option for for a rooftop / mesh wifi rig,
especially if one of the radios or ethernet switches has a spare RJ45 jack
or even an USB jack. The USB jack could be interesting, in that it could
let you use an inexpensive GPIO breakout board to provide the screw
terminals and voltage translation for monitoring battery health and charger
controller activity.  Maybe a USB to GPIO breakout like this:
http://www.dx.com/p/crius-ftdi-basic-breakout-5v-usb-to-ttl-6-pin-module-for-mwc-multiwii-lite-se-228307#.U3j8eI_XPPU

The web UI and monitoring logic could run directly on the USB host.

Indeed, Ubiquiti Rocket radios do have a USB jack although I'm uncertain of
their support in OpenWRT.  The Rockets do have rather generous 64MB RAM,
tho.

Actually Ben, the X-320 product is only $300. Still not cheap, but maybe
you were thinking of the solar charge controller with built in Ethernet
and web access?

The GPIO idea is very interesting, would that be supported by OpenWRT,
or a set of shell scripts on the host?

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Battlemesh talk about mesh-wide channel hopping
	(for DFS, etc)
Message-ID: <CADSh-SOfmWMmmi_d34BGpoerm03V2JVe5NQuQe8OdxWjzkAqFg@mail.gmail.com>

Simon Wunderlich gave a talk at this year's Battlemesh about progress in
implementing DFS (dynamic frequency selection) in mesh networks, whether
through user-space tools or in kernel space.

http://www.battlemesh.org/BattleMeshV7/Agenda?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=2014-05-17_wbmv7_DFS.pdf

The intended application from Simon's perspective is to permit automated
channel hopping for meshes, as required for operating on those 5.8GHz bands
shared with radar installations.  Although his talk focused on the EU
regulatory environment, the incentives for using these channel in the US
would be similar (avoiding otherwise crowded channels).

My understanding is that the FCC presently requires unlicensed 5.8GHz
radios operating on these channels to be be able to sense the present of
radar and hop to another channel, and Ubiquiti stock firmware for their
AirMAX products (e.g. Nanostation M5) now does this.  W/r/t running adhoc
networks on DFS channels, I'm not sure if the FCC explicitly forbids
beaconing, or if radios may sample the band for 30secs before sending out
beacons.  The FCC regs may be vague on this detail right now.

I'm pointing out this particular talk, however, because the ability for a
mesh to reliably channel-hop would also be *very useful* for 2.4GHz
meshes.  That band now sees potentially destructive noise from
channel-hopping neighbors, i.e. one day your mesh works, the next day it
doesn't.  Manually keeping up where a clear channel happens to be becomes
increasingly untenable.

Any high-level thoughts about mesh-wide noise sensing and channel hopping
schemes for a platform like Commotion?

I had some thoughts a while back about using nodes for spectrum
sensing and came across LinSSID, a Linux-based spectrum analyzer:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linssid/

It uses the Linux Wi-Fi drivers to dynamically sense the spectrum
environment across compatible channels. It's probably too resource
intense to run on the average node, but could be used on higher
resource backbone nodes (or client devices) and could feed the data
into a central server.

Obviously, this would largely tie up the node's radio while it was
sampling the spectrum, but it wouldn't have to do it continuously,
only say every hour or even once a day.

Sorry for responding after only skimming the links you provided.  I was
initially thinking you were looking at an inexpensive 'dumb' charge
controller that did not have its own monitoring output ports.  With such a
charge controller, the battery voltage could be wired to A/D terminals on
some sort of inexpensive GPIO breakout peripheral connected to a USB host.
(I.e. an rPi, the USB port on a Rocket).

Besides having (somewhat crude) battery voltage monitoring via an
inexpensive A/D, what modes of active control would be needed for the
charge controller itself?  I do read about desire to power cycle or reboot
equipment connected to the load, which could be done with an rPi and relays.

Indeed, using a tool that switches a node's radio over to monitor mode
would yield lots of info about free or occupied channels, although this
would have to be 'out of band' since it effectively disables the AP.  I was
curious more about doing periodic noise surveys using both the 'iw wlan0
survey dump' tool, in conjunction with the link ETX values reported by
olsrd, so as to not disable the AP.

The survey dump could at least help identify those neighbor's APs which are
particularly strong (i.e. sources of interference).  The link ETX values,
along with the signal dB values vs. TX retry amounts reported by iw wlan0
station dump, would give some measure of the current channel's quality.

It would be great to see something like this implemented, as spectrum
is only going to get tighter and tighter as time goes on.

Most OpenWRT devices should support "auto" Wi-Fi channel selection by
default, do we know what mechanism is used to select those channels?
There may already be driver-level noise or channel quality hooks in
the system to use, and expand upon.

The coordination across the mesh will be the tricky part, as Simon
points out. Hopefully across the community some solutions will come up!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] distribution of load among gateways and speed
	gains?
Message-ID: <53834F5B.2040307@wisc.edu>

     Our neighborhood mesh is small but growing steadily.  We have gateways on the mesh that vary by about 10 fold in speed.  Can someone explain if and how the commotion mesh distributes load between the gateways and if those linked to the wireless routers on the slow gateways can expect any speed increase because of the distributed load?
     Using common speed test websites (www.speedtest.net and www.bandwidthplace.com) I see no gain in speed by being linked to the mesh. However, I am unsure if those types of speed tests are appropriate for a mesh network.
     When a gateway goes down, the attached node switches to another gateway to access the internet, as it should. But I can't see evidence that nodes attached to slow gateways receive speed benefits by having fast gateways on the mesh.  Any insights or pointers to, not too technical, documentation?
thanks,
john

This is a useful overview of the legal issues of hosting an open

or prospective network operators, on this list might appreciate it,
especially since I'm sure many of you get asked these questions
frequently from folks you approach about hosting Commotion nodes.

Hi John,

As it currently works, OLSRd (the routing program we use) has a
SmartGateway plugin to distribute gateways to the mesh. Unfortunately,
the way this plugin works is to tell a node to use the nearest gateway
it can find, without regard to the capacity or latency of that gateway
compared to others. So, if my node is 1 hop away from a slow gateway and
2 hops away from a fast gateway, it will always choose the slow gateway
(assuming link quality is relatively homogeneous). Bummer, I know.

The good news is that, if I recall correctly, version 2 of OLSRd has a
much smarter way of choosing gateways, that does in fact take into
account gateway characteristics. So once we move to OSLRd version 2,
that problem will hopefully be alleviated.

But for now, we'll have to work around that limitation.

hope that helps!

Dan

Upgrading to OLSRd version 2 is something we hope to do in the not too
long future, perhaps within the next 6 months, but I really can't say
for sure. For now, it's a limitation we have to live with.

Buenas tardes

Podrian darme una guia de como debo hacer la configuraci?n si tengo un
servidor DHCP en un Mikrotik. Me explico mejor


Internet ---> RB450G ---> Sectorial ---> NanoStation M5 ---> PicoStation M2
---> PicoStation M2
                   DHCP
                R1                       R1

El Nanostation M5 esta conectado al PicoStation por cable y los dos
PicoStation M2 se deben conectar inalambricamente para empezar a formar la
red MESH, la idea es que todo que en Bridge para que a los clientes se les
asigne IP desde el Mikrotik

Gracias y espero haberme podido explicar

Hola Cesar,

En Commotion, no es posible para clientes que no estan conectados al
Mikrotik (por ejemplo, cuando el cliente esta conectado al NanoStation o
al PicoStation) obtener IP desde el Mikrotik. Cada nodo de Commotion
tiene un servidor DHCP, y clientes que estan conectado al nodo obtendr?
IP desde el nodo, no desde el router "upstream".

Si necesitas un configuraci?n en que todos los clientes en la red mesh
se les asigne IP desde un router singular, una red que usa BATMAN-Adv es
una opci?n mejor.

Sin embargo, en la mayor?a de los casos, no necesitas todos los clientes
recibir IP de un router singular. En Commotion, todos los clientes
pueden comunicar a pesar de que reciben IPs desde routers diferentes.

Tenemos configuraciones diferentes en el sitio de web:
http://commotionwireless.net/docs/cck/installing-configuring/common-configurations

Espero que este es ut?l, y lo siento por el mal espa?ol :)

-Dan

have to add a QoS web interface to Commotion which is modeled after the QoS
interface in the Easy Tomato firmware is the one for which i would really
like to work . I went through the Easy Tomato firmware and all charged up
to start working... Can you all suggest me the features that you all would
like to have in the Qos Web interface ??

Thanks a lot for help in advance..
I am really looking forward to this project.. :)

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] for discussion- running local apps on Commotion
	networks
Message-ID: <53305054.1040707@opentechinstitute.org>

Hello Commotion-Discuss subscribers:

A common question we receive is "What applications can I run on a
Commotion network? How do I set up xyz application?

For instance,
- How do we perform file sharing?
- How do we perform text, voice, or video chat sessions?
- How about mesh email, chat rooms, bulletin board systems, etc?
- What software currently exists to enable the non-technical person to
use a GUI to perform useful functions?

If you have experience or ideas about what applications are useful in
this situation, or are already running apps on a local Commotion
network, please join the discussion.

Part of what we're hoping to address is proving documentation on how to
set up and run network applications on a local mesh network, whether
it's connected to the Internet or not.

Running network applications on a local mesh is very similar to running
applications on the way Internet, and requires at a minimum a server
hosting the app, service, etc on the mesh. That service can be
advertised between Commotion mesh routers very easily so people
connecting to a mesh can find out about the application or service. So
the person(s) running the mesh can put together a server and advertise
the service (websites, chat server, database, etc) to network users. We
hope to have a basic guide in the near future on how to set up an
application server and connect it to a commotion mesh, however there is
no currently an out of the box easy setup solution.

Hi Chris,

One application that has some level of success on the Montreal
mesh (R?seau libre) is Coquelicot:
https://coquelicot.potager.org/

It allows users to upload large files, which then get automatically
encrypted on the server. The user gets a unique URL/key to share
that file. The file is deleted after a set number of days.

While we would like people to communicate in a true peer to peer
fashion, many users do not have the resources to setup their own
servers at home, so it was a good way to encourage the adoption of
mesh-only services, while avoiding legal issues of hosting other
people's data.

My personal wishlist for a mesh-app would be an easy way to do
backups, similar to Crashplan between users, but free/libre.
Users could select one or many peers to backup with, set space
quotas and encrypt data before sending (ex: duplicity).

Mathieu

I've been thinking about this too, I'd like to have something like
turnkeylinux[1] that's easy to run and without default passwords.

Seems not so easy to run two services on one instance though, so you
might end end up with at lot of servers, virtual or physical...

Perhaps we could create some installer to just tick which services to
install/enable at launch?

Personally, I'd like to have something like tidepools[2] with an easy
install option to grab a map from openstreetmaps.org :-)

Good ideas Christian and Mathieu, I'll have to investigate these links.

*Before this discussion was posted to the mailing list, I received the
following response to the original support topic:*

*"Running network applications on a local mesh is very similar to running
> applications on the way Internet, and requires at a minimum a server
> hosting the app, service, etc on the mesh. That service can ce advertised

*I responded to the above statement with: *

These were some of my thoughts and just wanted to post them to the mailing
list to see what others thought. Jitsi, Linphone, and Retroshare would be
computer based, but running advertised web based applications on the node
would also be an interesting route.

I am very new to this stuff, so forgive me if I sound naive. I am so
fascinated with the possibilities for these networks and just can't resist
getting involved. I figure I'll learn along the way.

Maybe OTI or folks running Commotion networks would be interested in
signing on to this?

It's unclear whether the iOS feature is actually adhoc/mesh wifi. You
can see some brief technical speculation here:
https://lists.chambana.net/pipermail/commotion-dev/2014-March/001773.html.
I would be curious to know more about the feature.

But FireChat is definitely not compatible with Commotion. In fact, Open
Garden and FireChat are completely proprietary and closed source, so
there's really no motivation to interoperate with them.

Peer-to-peer mobile is certainly exciting, especially on iOS, but
sometimes the excitement overshadows the more important political and
technical details.

It's such a shame that this closed source project is getting so much
hype in the media recently, as some sort of panacea for connectivity and
everything that enables, with little to no (I haven't seen any) talk
about why proprietary software like this is so problematic.

Here's a rant about Open Garden I can appreciate:

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] A Business Model for Community Wireless
Message-ID: <CAK7iR0x43zoUCpOksMVzsqPjgzcrgaMKYp648vw+a8UQ3_0zBw@mail.gmail.com>

This is a long story, but I am putting out this outline of a business model
for community wireless in the hopes that we can actually implement this
somewhere at a scale, and replicate the model to really start making access
to global information an inherent right of all people.

I have been working on this for a while, and have not published it until
this point. But the model has come to a theoretical point where it won't
move without more help or more information. Thanks to all that have helped
on this: Nitin, my Milwaukee geek friends, and Georgia, Greta and Andy from
OTI

START!
I followed a Human-Centered Design process to figure out the details and
cost-recovery opportunity in response to a problem I found in my other
community work: Why do close to *50% of families* in Milwaukee have
computers/phones but *don't have access to the Internet*? Turns out some
families have to choose between food and Internet, so they turn it on and
off or just leave it off.

So I wanted to develop a model that created opportunity but wouldn't be
completely beholden to the whims of a single funding source or shut down by
politics. That means a self-sustaining cost-recovery model. So I got a few
folks together and we did a pilot in Milwaukee. I am proud to say that the
antennae has survived an entire summer and winter thanks to planning
efforts with the OTI technical staff. :)

Here it goes.

DETAILS!
*Position Statement: The best way to empower people is by making sure they
have the information they need and the know-how to use it to improve the
lives of their family and neighbors.*

*This is a validated model with a pilot in place, so we already have lots
of feedback that shows this can work and what is needed to make it work.*

TREND
In Milwaukee, many families struggle to get access to information that can
keep them informed. In addition, many families in the Milwaukee area have
access to technology but not regular access to local information and the
Internet.

PROBLEM
Lack of regular, affordable access to information and Internet technology
creates a huge digital divide for struggling families. This puts their
children at a disadvantage in an economy where technical education is key.
In addition, lack of regular access to updated information on the Internet
does not allow residents to take control of their block and neighborhoods,
which would be more possible to organize using technical tools.

SOLUTION
Provide neighborhood-level information technology infrastructure that
connects residents to the Internet and each another and gives them a
private information portal to organize. Support this infrastructure by
teaching neighborhood teens and adults to support those systems through a
training and internship program that provides technical training.

The icing on the cake is to incorporate a cost-recovery model that allows
the program to flourish without demanding ongoing operational money from
local and national foundations.

WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT
With regular access to the Internet, families can save money. The
neighborhood information portal not only allows local community activists
to better organize people to increase public safety, it allows them to more
easily distribute information that helps residents be safer and smarter
about economic, political and social challenges in their neighborhood.

Training local residents to support their neighbors not only helps build
community, it provides essential technical training to areas where those
programs are not readily available.

HOW IT WORKS
We implement a neighborhood portal (using an open-source version of
nextdoor.com called Anahita) to build neighborhood level information
portals. These portals are private and only accessible to local residents
who have a login, allowing them to discuss public safety concerns without
fear of monitoring or scrutiny.

As many households lack regular access to the Internet but have computers
and mobile phones, we would place a wireless mesh network in the
neighborhood using the open-source Commotion platform. A local community
partner would be our access point to the Internet.

To help support and steward the technology, we will roll out a training and
internship program with our neighborhood community partners to train
neighborhood residents to be the Level 1 support team for the mesh and
information portal. In neighborhoods with block watch programs, we work
with those local block watch captains to populate and promote information
on the portal.

FINANCIAL NUMBERS
Here is a link to the proforma. It basically shows that this kind of effort
can sustain its cost, but can't afford to sustain the administrative cost
of someone to run the whole thing. That means (to me) we need to partner
with an organization which has that kind of people power (or wants it).
They provide the administrative persons, the model makes sure there is no
financial drain on the parent organization. My numbers are thought out, but
maybe not as easy to decipher, so please ask questions.

We are slowly growing, we will add our 4th node in a couple days. There is a lot of neighborhood interest but we're growing very cautiously.

As we grow, I am wondering how to monitor the gateways to the internet so that when one goes down I can quickly ask the owner to contact their service provider.  An email once or twice a day to let me know what gateways are fully functional or an email notice when a gateway looses connection to the internet would be ideal. Is there software built-in or as a service that could do this?  Any suggestions?

Buenos dias

Tengo un nodo con la versi?n 1.0 de Commotion Wireless y la interface WIRED
la tengo como cliente DHCP, ya tengo internet y todo va bien pero no puedo
ingresar a la direccion que me asigna el servidor DHCP al nodo.

Que regla debo crear o que configuracion debo hacerpara poder ingresar al
nodo??

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Brick or Nanostation?
Message-ID: <CAKenKpKqEwnmTPawhZGybR2uZ-GWJuGh_prFeLa=KJ33fgkmTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey yesterday I upgraded a Nano on the roof of AMP (via ethernet/web
interface)  from DR2 to 1.0 and then lost contact with it.
I tried to go into TFTP mode (with the special reset button POE) held the
button in for 8 seconds and still no ping. I also had something similar
happen when upgrading another Nano from DR 1 to DR2. In both instances I
only have access to the POE.

I could better troubleshoot if I had physical access but the snow is making
me wait.
Just wondered if anyone experienced this before or if maybe someone quick
remedy.


Thanks!

Message-ID: <52D079B6.4070709@opentechinstitute.org>

Developers and network maintainers might want to check out our blog post
on significant backwards-imcompatible changes in the R1 release:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/commotion-r1-breaking-changes

In summary:
* Mesh IP addresses are now self-assigned in the 100.64.0.0/10 range and
all client subnets are bridged and assigned addresses in the 10.0.0.0/8
range
* default adhoc SSID and channel were removed
* adhoc BSSID is now deterministically generated based on hash of SSID
and channel

The blog post explains the details and reasoning behind these changes,
for those that are interested, and also includes info on upgrading
pre-R1 Commotion networks.

You can also find R1 release notes here:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/commotion-router-v1-release-notes

cheers,
Dan

Thanks Anderson for pointing this out.

Yes, in earlier versions you could log back onto a node using the
static IP 192.168.1.20, but that was back when we were still using the
192.168.x.x address range.

Now the process is:
Flash the node using the static ip 192.168.1.20
Reset your ethernet port to use DHCP
Wait for a lease from the router (you should get an ip address in the
10.x.x.x range)
Once you're connected with a lease, type "thisnode" (no quotation
marks) into the browser.

There were a lot of substantive changes between DR2 and Version 1, and
our documentation is still being updated to match.

By all means, please share any similar issues in the software or the
documentation that you find.

Thanks again!

Grady

Hey Dan - we don't have out report out from the trip to Tunisia yet, but
we are working on it now. There should be a good amount of information
in that on how we set-up the server and applications (as well as a lot
of information about the entire network and how we went about setting
that up with the Sayada community).

In the meantime - Will, could you give us a few notes on how you set up
the local Open Street Maps and Wikipedia instances?

Thanks,

All of the addressing changes look like great ideas.

Question: is the decision to address all clients within the address space
10.0.0.0/8 to, among other things, help make client roaming between nodes
easier?  I.e. implying that clients would be assigned the same IP
regardless of which node they associate with?

I noticed this item filed in the feature queue just now:

We actually hadn't considered that since the access point handover is a
pretty large project for down the line. It was more for the sake of
simplicity, IIRC.

Handover aside, I also don't think retaining a client IP address would
be possible without some restructuring, since the 10.0.0.0/8 client
subnet on each router is chosen to be unique (in order to avoid
collision), i.e. the router assigns client IP addresses on the
10.a.b.0/24 range, where a and b correspond to the last two bytes of the
router's MAC address.

But it's still worth considering. Do you think retaining client IP
addresses would provide some benefits, as opposed to just getting a new
IP address when switching APs?

Issuing clients a unique IP in the 10.x.x.x space, regardless of the
specific node associated with, could possibly let client roaming occur more
smoothly.  Giving clients their own unique IPs seems like it would be the
logical extension of bridging all client subnets, right?  Likewise, this
could work toward eliminating some of the layers of NAT within the mesh and
lay groundwork for NAT-free ipv6?

At any rate, issuing clients unique IPs is actually what is done in many
conventional hotspots deployments with multiple APs, whereby the APs (all
broadcasting the SSID) are wired back to a central router that issues DHCP
leases to all clients.  That is, Ubiquiti UniFi operates like this, and I
think even the batman-adv routing in Cloudtrax nodes use may also do this
now, too.

For meshing nodes, some non-trivial parts of smooth client roaming would be
factors like ...

0. When a client roams from node A to node B, how to reliably detect that
event and react to it immediately.    hostapd does write to syslog when a
new client associates.  Nodes could poll hostapd via syslog or via wpa_cli
to discover when a new client associates.  Or there is possibly a more
elegant way to trigger an action upon new client association which I
haven't found yet.

1. When a client roams from node A to node B, while retaining client IP,
how to inform node B to begin routing traffic from that client.

2. When a client roams from node A to node B, how to inform node B's
captive portal to *not* redirect the client to the splash page.  Similar to
#1, this could also be accomplished with nodes sharing the list of active
client MACs (perhaps also with an incrementing session time for each
client), so that incoming roaming clients don't get bounced back to the
splash page.  Or, such a list could be used so that every client *does* get
bounced back to the splash page, regardless of how many nodes he has roamed
to, after some operator-defined timeout has elapsed.

Hey there!

We were wondering about restrictions for nodes' administrator
passwords. Does anyone have thoughts on what requirements (if any)
these passwords should have?

Examples might be: minimum of eight characters, must include capital
letters and numbers, etc.

Thanks for bringing this up, Luigi. It appears that client-to-client
routing doesn't work as it should in R1, something that we failed to
test before release. The problem is the default firewall configuration.

To fix this problem, run the following commands on the nodes in your
network:

NEW_RULE=$(uci add firewall forwarding)
uci set firewall.${NEW_RULE}.src=mesh
uci set firewall.${NEW_RULE}.dest=lan
uci commit firewall
/etc/init.d/firewall restart

That should hopefully take care of the issue you're seeing. Let us know
if that doesn't work!

Hey Dan!

Sorry it's taken me so long to respond! To answer your questions about
Open Street Map is a little, er, involved, but Wikipedia is easy :-) I
will take them in the order of easy to hard ...

For Wikipedia, we were given a copy of the data on a thumb drive from a
local user. He captured the Arabic and the French versions of Wikipedia
from a project called kiwix (http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page). I
copied that data onto the local server. The best part about this project
is that it comes with its own web server. Inside the package is a
kiwix-serve program (http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-serve). I ran this
on port 8080 and voila! If you are running Kiwix on something Linux-y,
the server comes precompiled so you don't even have to build it.

For Open Street Map, it was a little more difficult. I am planning to
write up a full guide on how I did this, but here is an overview.

The goal was to have data for Tunisia hosted locally and displayed on a
slippy map (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map). I thought
that it would be good to use OpenLayers (http://openlayers.org/) to do
that, which meant that I somehow needed to build up some tiles
(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles). Those tiles are rendered
from the OSM base data (which is XML format) and turned into PNGs
(rasterized).

To start, I used one of the OSM APIs to get the OSM data for Tunisia.
The xapi API (might be redundant) allows you to query for a the OSM data
within a bounding box. See more here:
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Xapi.

Once I collected that data, I had to import it into a PostGIS postgres
database. This was a real sticking point for me. I used osm2pgsql to do
that (http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) after I created a
PostGIS compatible database using the instructions from
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PostGIS/Installation.

Once I got the data into PostGIS, I was able to start styling the data.
Because that was much more complicated than I anticipated, I decided to
rely on the styling information that the OSM people use to style their
public maps. I got that from the openstreetmap-carto repo on github
(https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto). Using that makes
the maps look really, really pretty.

Once I got Mapnik/TileMill to create a nice looking style, I could start
the render process! I used a render script that I found online at
https://github.com/newsapps/making-maps-demo (specifically the
render_tiles.py file). The rendering process creates a normal directory
of PNG files. (See attached example)

Those tiles are, finally, the input we need for OpenLayers. Installation
of OpenLayers is relatively straightforward and requires simply a
webserver to serve some JS and those PNG files.

Breath.

The process for doing this was only hard when I really had no idea what
I was doing. The further I got into the process, the more reasonable it
seemed. Please PLEASE send questions and let me know if there are parts
of the process (either for Wikipedia or OSM) that I can clarify. I'd
love to help you get this going for your local app servers.

I hope this helps! Again, I'm sorry that it has taken me so long to respond!

Will

When I read it, I was thinking, "hey that sounds kind of like...oh. Ok,
it's mesh."

Proprietary issues aside, it's interesting. Of course, sharing internet
bandwidth is nothing new with mesh networks; any OLSRd-based network
like Commotion provides internet bandwidth sharing from multiple gateways.

What I'm still curious about is *how* BeWifi pools or distributes that
bandwidth. Unless there is some sort of network coding/multipath TCP
functionality (which would require similar capabilities at the
destination), it is presumably just doing optimized gateway selection to
route a user's traffic to the internet. OLSRd's Smart Gateway plugin
does this, sort of, but without bandwidth measurements AFAIK. Although I
hear OLSRd v2 can do this even better.

Also interesting that it's being piloted in Catalonia...I wonder how
Guifi.net feels about it ;)

Quoting details about the actual hardware being built:

"The way Telefonica has made this happen in a practical way is to build its
own routers that can be installed in houses within a neighborhood. So far
these have had to be installed by engineers, but the next generation are
plug-and-play, and eventually all that will be needed is an over-the-air
software update to customers' existing routers. According to Rodriguez, the
software 'creates a mesh to aggregate the capabilities [of the routers].'
Pooling all of the bandwidth from these routers allows anyone within the
network to take advantage of it at home, and they can also connect to any
BeWifi network they come across on their mobile devices when out and about."

It could very well be the Telefonica routers would do some sort intelligent
repeating or meshing wirelessly, although I'm guessing much of the
bandwidth optimization may be accomplished by ensuring adjacent access
points do not overlap channels or broadcast with excessive TX power.  (This
is because I'm assuming Telefonica provides its broadband service nominally
via conventional wireline, e.g. DSL or cable, and actual wireless backhaul
in such a scheme would be used seldom.)

My question: would Telefonica subscribers then be *required* to use the
router provided, with its stock firmware, per revised ToS?  And likewise
they would be given very limited admin permissions on that device (e.g.
change the SSID and WPA key, but little else)?  I can understand the need
to compel subscribers as such to ensure uniform bandwidth management, but
it still seems like this walks in opposite directions of what community
mesh advocates are seeking.

That's extremely interesting. Does anyone know where that code landed?
I've been looking through the openwrt-dev list but don't see anything
obvious talking about the submission.

Hi All,

MarinaZ & Jen Wike from Red Hat asked me to participate in their women in
Open Source series on OpenSource.com, so I ended up talking about the UI
review process that we did as part of the Version 1 Release.

The first of two just went up today!

Just heard about arkOS, an Raspberry Pi OS for self-hosting your data.
Not a new concept (see: FreedomBox), but I found their visual
description of the internet vs. self-hosting to be interesting:
https://arkos.io/cloud.

I hope we can incorporate similar visual language to explain Commotion
and local applications.

I was just checking to see if their had been any progress made on the
nightly builds with fixing the memory overload causing the nodes to
crash. To try and prevent my node from crashing I disabled serval and
the splash page. However, whenever I have 15 to 20 students login to a
local app at the start of class my node crashes instantly. I'm wondering
if upgrading to the latest nightly build might fix this issue. Lastly,
if I upgrade to the latest nightly build will it still work with the
other nodes that do not have the latest build or do I have to or is it
recommend that I upgrade all of the other nodes to latest build as
well?  Thanks for all the hard work.  Commotion is otherwise working
wonders over here in the horn.

+commotion-dev

If your nodes are crashing w/ 15-20 clients, while both serval and
commotion-splash are disabled, that is very worrisome!

I propose to the Commotion dev team that we urgently need to come up
with a way to simulate network load, so we can identify and fix the
causes of these types of crashes. Does anyone have ideas or experiences
with this? Perhaps we can take the technical discussion over to the
commotion-dev list only.

And just an update for you Dan, earlier this week I found and fixed a
significant memory leak in Serval...not sure how much that will affect
the instability we've seen, but we'll soon know with some testing. The
fix will make its way into the nightly builds probably by the end of the
week.

As long as the rest of your network is DR1 or newer, the nightly builds
should be compatible.

I am also seeing sporadic memory consumption issues operating mesh nodes
running AA r38347 in WasabiNet on Nanostation Loco M2.

That is, using the same ath9k wifi driver and same underlying OS, but
without the Commotion-specific tools like commotiond and servald.  I will
see nodes boot up with ~26Mbytes memory usage and then gradually increase
over the next few days until sporadic nodes start crashing with page
allocation failures (aka memory exhausted).  This all is happening despite
having 3Mbytes of compressed swap space allocated.    When I am able to log
into crashed nodes to inspect, I will occasionally find the current memory
usage to be *less* than the average observed on bootup, along with
~500Kbytes sitting in swap.

This seems to suggest something is very sporadically allocating itself a
large chunk (multiple MBytes), but not residing in memory as such, and
causing other processes to crash in consequence.  I do use the coovachilli
captive portal in WasabiNet, which could be a culprit and thus unrelated to
Commotion, but there could also be an underlying memory leak in the kernel
or wifi driver.

What are thoughts for having crashed nodes try to collect a debug report
about themselves when a crash condition is detected (e.g. no Internet
access, "page allocation failure" detected in syslog), and then write that
report to flash somewhere before the node get rebooted by its frustrated
user?

Besides that, do note that nodes with only 32MBytes of RAM, like UBNT
Picostations, are going to have difficulties hosting local apps for many
users.  If Dan Hasting would be able to use an alternate device with
64Mbytes+ RAM, e.g. a UBNT Rocket, Unifi, or even an indoor TP-Link router
(all of which should be able to run Commotion-OpenWRT), that may be a
viable workaround in cause chasing down memory leaks becomes too ornery.

Regarding logging, I'm not sure that will work well since the nodes are
spontaneously rebooting themselves (due to OOM conditions), not the user
rebooting them. What we're going to try to do is attach a serial console
(thanks Will!) and try to slam the router with simultaneous users and
traffic.

Also, I don't think Dan is hosting local apps on the router itself
(correct me if I'm wrong), but just advertising them using the Commotion
apps portal. And that's just takes a little space for the Avahi service
file...so hopefully that's not a problem.

We'll certainly report what we find with our stress testing.

Hi Dan,

Thanks for offering more detail, especially that you see the nodes
spontaneously reboot rather than simple have services crash.

I would again point out that the Picostations will have a finite limit for
simultaneous clients.  15 to 20 clients is quite a few, each client
requiring a portion of available of RAM.  It may be a single Picostation is
not going to be able to sustain all of them.

Since Dan Hastings has seen this happen with a lot of simultaneous
clients and with high-memory components disabled, it sounds like that is
likely the cause. Do you know exactly where that RAM is used for each
connecting client?

Dan, can you provide any more detailed info on exactly what was
happening when you see the node crashing? How many simultaneous users,
and what were they doing (viewing a webpage on the internet, or viewing
the node's administrative web interface, etc)?

I was under the impression that PicoStations could support roughly 30 users?

It's relevant to point out that devices like Picostation and Nanostation
are normally intended for use as thin hotspots in high-usage environments,
i.e. DHCP and NAT routing not done on the device itself.  So,
Commotion-OpenWRT issuing DHCP leases and performing NAT one or 2 local
LANs onboard does consume memory that otherwise would go to serving 802.11n
clients.  This is an inherent limitation of the chosen architecture.

Besides that, I would assume at least these processes need to devote a
portion of available RAM to each client on the public AP in
Commotion-OpenWRT:

   - /proc/net/nf_conntrack entries
   - nodogsplash (although possibly only on initial portal page viewing)
   - uhttpd (again, only on portal page viewing)
   - the ath9k driver itself

30 simultaneous users would be what I'd expect when using a Picostation M2
just as a stand-alone hotspot, i.e. without having it issue DHCP leases or
do NAT routing.  Because Commotion (and by extension most mesh node
firmware projects) are running additional services directly on the
hotspots, e.g. serval, olsrd, uhttpd, commotiond, wpa_supplicant, along
with the additional virtual wireless interface(s), this will reduce the the
number of simultaneous AP clients per node that can be reliably supported.

10 simultaneous users per node may be a better limit, albeit on the
assumption that additional memory leak fixes or optimizations are done to
shave a couple Mbytes or so off the firmware's current memory footprint.

Again, do remember the underlying nature of mesh node networks assumes each
node to be rather lightweight.  The "meshy" approach to supporting many
users is to distribute them across multiple nodes.

You Are a Rogue Device
A New Apparatus Capable of Spying on You Has Been Installed Throughout
Downtown Seattle. Very Few Citizens Know What It Is, and Officials Don?t
Want to Talk About It.

by Matt Fikse-Verkerk and Brendan Kiley

If you're walking around downtown Seattle, look up: You'll see off-white
boxes, each one about a foot tall with vertical antennae, attached to
utility poles. If you're walking around downtown while looking at a
smartphone, you will probably see at least one?and more likely two or
three?Wi-Fi networks named after intersections: "4th&Seneca,"
"4th&Union," "4th&University," and so on. That is how you can see the
Seattle Police Department's new wireless mesh network, bought from a
California-based company called Aruba Networks, whose clients include
the Department of Defense, school districts in Canada, oil-mining
interests in China, and telecommunications companies in Saudi Arabia.

The question is: How well can this mesh network see you?

How accurately can it geo-locate and track the movements of your phone,
laptop, or any other wireless device by its MAC address (its "media
access control address"?nothing to do with Macintosh?which is analogous
to a device's thumbprint)? Can the network send that information to a
database, allowing the SPD to reconstruct who was where at any given
time, on any given day, without a warrant? Can the network see you now?

The SPD declined to answer more than a dozen questions from The
Stranger, including whether the network is operational, who has access
to its data, what it might be used for, and whether the SPD has used it
(or intends to use it) to geo-locate people's devices via their MAC
addresses or other identifiers.

Seattle Police detective Monty Moss, one of the leaders of the
mesh-network project?one part of a $2.7 million effort, paid for by the
Department of Homeland Security?wrote in an e-mail that the department
"is not comfortable answering policy questions when we do not yet have a
policy." But, Detective Moss added, the SPD "is actively collaborating
with the mayor's office, city council, law department, and the ACLU on a
use policy." The ACLU, at least, begs to differ: "Actively
collaborating" is not how they would put it. Jamela Debelak, technology
and liberty director of the Seattle office, says the ACLU submitted
policy-use suggestions months ago and has been waiting for a response.

Detective Moss also added that the mesh network would not be used for
"surveillance purposes... without City Council's approval and the
appropriate court authorization." Note that he didn't say the mesh
network couldn't be used for the surveillance functions we asked about,
only that it wouldn't?at least until certain people in power say it can.
That's the equivalent of a "trust us" and a handshake.

His answer is inadequate for other reasons as well. First, the city
council passed an ordinance earlier this year stating that any potential
surveillance equipment must submit protocols to the city council for
public review and approval within 30 days of its acquisition and
implementation. This mesh network has been around longer than that, as
confirmed by Cascade Networks, Inc., which helped install it. Still, the
SPD says it doesn't have a policy for its use yet. Mayor McGinn's office
says it expects to see draft protocols sometime in December?nearly nine
months late, according to the new ordinance.

Second, and more importantly, this mesh network is part of a whole new
arsenal of surveillance technologies that are moving faster than the
laws that govern them are being written. As Stephanie K. Pell (former
counsel to the House Judiciary Committee) and Christopher Soghoian
(senior policy analyst at the ACLU) wrote in a 2012 essay for the
Berkeley Technology Law Journal:

    The use of location information by law enforcement agencies is
common and becoming more so as technological improvements enable
collection of more accurate and precise location data. The legal mystery
surrounding the proper law enforcement access standard for prospective
location data remains unsolved. This mystery, along with conflicting
rulings over the appropriate law enforcement access standards for both
prospective and historical location data, has created a messy,
inconsistent legal landscape where even judges in the same district may
require law enforcement to meet different standards to compel location
data.

In other words, law enforcement has new tools?powerful tools. We didn't
ask for them, but they're here. And nobody knows the rules for how they
should be used.

This isn't the first time the SPD has purchased surveillance equipment
(or, as they might put it, public-safety equipment that happens to have
powerful surveillance capabilities) without telling the rest of the
city. There was the drones controversy this past winter, when the public
and elected officials discovered that the SPD had bought two unmanned
aerial vehicles with the capacity to spy on citizens. There was an
uproar, and a few SPD officers embarked on a mea culpa tour of community
meetings where they answered questions and endured (sometimes raucous)
criticism. In February, Mayor Mike McGinn announced he was grounding the
drones, but a new mayor could change his mind. Those SPD drones are
sitting somewhere right now on SPD property.

Meanwhile, the SPD was also dealing with the port-camera surveillance
scandal. That kicked off in late January, when people in West Seattle
began wondering aloud about the 30 cameras that had appeared unannounced
on utility poles along the waterfront. The West Seattle neighborhood
blog (westseattleblog.com) sent questions to city utility companies, and
the utilities in turn pointed at SPD, which eventually admitted that it
had purchased and installed 30 surveillance cameras with federal money
for "port security." That resulted in an additional uproar and another
mea culpa tour, much like they did with the drones, during which
officers repeated that they should have done a better job of educating
the public about what they were up to with the cameras on Alki.
(Strangely, the Port of Seattle and the US Coast Guard didn't seem very
involved in this "port security" project?their names only appear in a
few cursory places in the budgets and contracts. The SPD is clearly the
driving agency behind the project. For example, their early tests of
sample Aruba products?beginning with a temporary Aruba mesh network set
up in Pioneer Square for Mardi Gras in 2009?didn't have anything to do
with the port whatsoever.)

The cameras attracted the controversy, but they were only part of the
project. In fact, the 30 pole-mounted cameras on Alki that caused the
uproar cost $82,682?just 3 percent of the project's $2.7 million
Homeland Security?funded budget. The project's full title was "port
security video surveillance system with wireless mesh network." People
raised a fuss about the cameras. But what about the mesh network?

Detective Moss and Assistant Chief Paul McDonagh mentioned the downtown
mesh network during those surveillance-camera community meetings, saying
it would help cops and firefighters talk to each other by providing a
wireless network for their exclusive use, with the potential for others
to use overlaid networks handled by the same equipment. (Two-way radios
already allow police officers to talk to each other, but officers still
use wireless networks to access data, such as the information an officer
looks for by running your license plate number when you've been pulled
over.)

As Brian Magnuson of Cascade Networks, Inc., which helped install the
Aruba system, explained the possible use of such a system: "A normal
cell-phone network is a beautiful thing right up until the time you
really need it?say you've just had an earthquake or a large storm, and
then what happens? Everybody picks up their phone and overloads the
system." The network is most vulnerable precisely when it's most needed.
A mesh network could be a powerful tool for streaming video from
surveillance cameras or squad car dash-cams across the network, allowing
officers "real-time situational awareness" even when other communication
systems have been overloaded, as Detective Moss explained in those
community meetings.

But the Aruba mesh network is not just for talking, it's also for tracking.

After reviewing Aruba's technical literature, as well as talking to IT
directors and systems administrators around the country who work with
Aruba products, it's clear that their networks are adept at seeing all
the devices that move through their coverage area and visually mapping
the locations of those devices in real time for the system
administrators' convenience. In fact, one of Aruba's major selling
points is its ability to locate "rogue" or "unassociated" devices?that
is, any device that hasn't been authorized by (and maybe hasn't even
asked to be part of) the network.

Which is to say, your device. The cell phone in your pocket, for instance.

The user's guide for one of Aruba's recent software products states:
"The wireless network has a wealth of information about unassociated and
associated devices." That software includes "a location engine that
calculates associated and unassociated device location every 30 seconds
by default... The last 1,000 historical locations are stored for each
MAC address."

For now, Seattle's mesh network is concentrated in the downtown area.
But the SPD has indicated in PowerPoint presentations?also acquired by
The Stranger?that it hopes to eventually have "citywide deployment" of
the system that, again, has potential surveillance capabilities that the
SPD declined to answer questions about. That could give a whole new
meaning to the phrase "real-time situational awareness."

So how does Aruba's mesh network actually function?

Each of those off-white boxes you see downtown is a wireless access
point (AP) with four radios inside it that work to shove giant amounts
of data to, through, and around the network, easily handling
bandwidth-hog uses such as sending live, high-resolution video to or
from moving vehicles. Because this grid of APs forms a latticelike mesh,
it works like the internet itself, routing traffic around bottlenecks
and "self-healing" by sending traffic around components that fail.

As Brian Magnuson at Cascade Networks explains: "When you have 10 people
talking to an AP, no problem. If you have 50, that's a problem." Aruba's
mesh solution is innovative?instead of building a few high-powered,
herculean APs designed to withstand an immense amount of traffic, Aruba
sprinkles a broad area with lots of lower-powered APs and lets them
figure out the best way to route all the data by talking to each other.

Aruba's technology is considered cutting-edge because its systems are
easy to roll out, administer, and integrate with other systems, and its
operating system visualizes what's happening on the network in a simple,
user-friendly digital map. The company is one of many firms in the
networking business, but, according to the tech-ranking firm Gartner,
Aruba ranks second (just behind Cisco) in "completeness of vision" and
third in "ability to execute" for its clever ways of getting around
technical hurdles.

Take Candlestick Park, the San Francisco 49ers football stadium, which,
Magnuson says, is just finishing up an Aruba mesh network installation.
The stadium has high-intensity cellular service needs?70,000 people can
converge there for a single event in one of the most high-tech cities in
America, full of high-powered, newfangled devices. "Aruba's solution was
ingenious," Magnuson says. It put 640 low-power APs under the stadium's
seats to diffuse the data load. "If you're at the stadium and trying to
talk to an AP," Magnuson says, "you're probably sitting on it!"

Another one of Aruba's selling points is its ability to detect rogue
devices?strangers to the system. Its promotional "case studies" trumpet
this capability, including one report about Cabela's hunting and
sporting goods chain, which is an Aruba client: "Because Cabela's stores
are in central shopping areas, the company captures huge quantities of
rogue data?as many as 20,000 events per day, mostly from neighboring
businesses." Aruba's network is identifying and distinguishing which
devices are allowed on the Cabela's network and which are within the
coverage area but are just passing through. The case study also
describes how Cabela's Aruba network was able to locate a lost
price-scanner gun in a large warehouse by mapping its location, as well
as track employees by the devices they were carrying.

It's one thing for a privately owned company to register devices it
already owns with a network. It's another for a local police department
to scale up that technology to blanket an entire downtown?or an entire city.

Aruba also sells a software product called "Analytics and Location
Engine 1.0." According to a document Aruba has created about the
product, ALE "calculates the location of associated and unassociated
wifi devices... even though a device has not associated to the network,
information about it is available. This includes the MAC address,
location, and RSSI information." ALE's default setting is anonymous,
which "allows for unique user tracking without knowing who the
individual user is." But, Aruba adds in the next sentence, "optionally
the anonymization can be disabled for richer analytics and user behavior
tracking." The network has the ability to see who you are?how deeply it
looks is up to whoever's using it. (The Aruba technology, as far as we
know, does not automatically associate a given MAC address with the name
on the device's account. But figuring out who owns the account?by asking
a cell-phone company, for example?would not be difficult for a
law-enforcement agency.)

Geo-location seems to be an area of intense interest for Aruba. Last
week, the Oregonian announced that Aruba had purchased a Portland
mapping startup called Meridian, which, according to the article, has
developed software that "pinpoints a smartphone's location inside a
venue, relying either on GPS technology or with localized wireless
networks." The technology, the article says, "helps people find their
way within large buildings, such as malls, stadiums, or airports and
enables marketing directed at a phone's precise location."

How does that geo-location work? Devices in the network's coverage area
are "heard" by more than one radio in those APs (the off-white boxes).
Once the network hears a device from multiple APs, it can compare the
strength and timing of the signal to locate where the device is. This is
classic triangulation, and users of Aruba's AirWave software?as in the
Cabela's example?report that their systems are able to locate devices to
within a few feet.

In the case of large, outdoor installations where APs are more spread
out, the ability to know what devices are passing through is
useful?especially, perhaps, to policing agencies, which could log that
data for long-term storage. As networking products and their uses
continue to evolve, they will only compound the "legal mystery" around
how this technology could and should be used that Pell and Soghoian
described in their Berkeley Technology Law Journal piece. Aruba's mesh
network is state-of-the-art, but something significantly smarter and
more sensitive will surely be on the market this time next year. And who
knows how much better the software will get.

An official spokesperson for Aruba wrote in an e-mail that the company
could not answer The Stranger's questions because they pertained "to a
new product announcement" that would not happen until Thanksgiving.
"Aruba's technology," the spokesperson added, "is designed for indoor
(not outdoor) usage and is for consumer apps where they opt in." This is
in direct contradiction to Aruba's own user's manuals, as well as the
fact that the Seattle Police Department installed an outdoor Aruba mesh
network earlier this year.

One engineer familiar with Aruba products and similar systems?who
requested anonymity?confirmed that the mesh network and its software are
powerful tools. "But like anything," the engineer said, it "can be used
inappropriately... You can easily see how a user might abuse this
ability (network admin has a crush on user X, monitors user X's location
specifically)." As was widely reported earlier this year, such alleged
abuses within the NSA have included a man who spied on nine women over a
five-year period, a woman who spied on prospective boyfriends, a man who
spied on his girlfriend, a husband who spied on his wife, and even a man
who spied on his ex-girlfriend "on his first day of access to the NSA's
surveillance system," according to the Washington Post. The practice was
so common within the NSA, it got its own classification: "LOVEINT."

Other Aruba clients?such as a university IT director, a university vice
president, and systems administrators?around the country confirmed it
wouldn't be difficult to use the mesh network to track the movement of
devices by their MAC addresses, and that building a historical database
of their movements would be relatively trivial from a data-storage
perspective.

As Bruce Burton, an information technology manager at the University of
Cincinnati (which uses an Aruba network), put it in an e-mail: "This
mesh network will have the capability to track devices (MAC addresses)
throughout the city."

Not that the SPD would do that?but we don't know. "We definitely feel
like the public doesn't have a handle on what the capabilities are,"
says Debelak of the ACLU. "We're not even sure the police department
does." It all depends on what the SPD says when it releases its
mesh-network protocols.

"They're long overdue," says Lee Colleton, a systems administrator at
Google who is also a member of the Seattle Privacy Coalition, a
grassroots group that formed in response to SPD's drone and
surveillance-camera controversies. "If we don't deal with this kind of
thing now, and establish norms and policies, we'll find ourselves in an
unpleasant situation down the road that will be harder to change."

The city is already full of surveillance equipment. The Seattle
Department of Transportation, for example, uses license-plate scanners,
sensors embedded in the pavement, and other mechanisms to monitor
individual vehicles and help estimate traffic volume and wait time. "But
as soon as that data is extrapolated," says Adiam Emery of SDOT, "it's
gone." They couldn't turn it over to a judge if they tried.

Not that license-plate scanners have always been so reliable. Doug Honig
of the ACLU remembers a story he heard from a former staffer a couple of
years ago about automatic license-plate readers on police cars in
Spokane. Automatic license-plate readers "will read a chain-link fence
as XXXXX," Honig says, "which at the time also matched the license plate
of a stolen car in Mississippi, resulting in a number of false alerts to
pull over the fence."

Seattle's mesh network is only one instance in a trend of Homeland
Security funding domestic surveillance equipment. Earlier this month,
the New York Times ran a story about a $7 million Homeland Security
grant earmarked for "port security"?just like the SPD's mesh-network
funding?in Oakland.

"But instead," the Times reports, "the money is going to a police
initiative that will collect and analyze reams of surveillance data from
around town?from gunshot- detection sensors in the barrios of East
Oakland to license plate readers mounted on police cars patrolling the
city's upscale hills."

The Oakland "port security" project, which the Times reports was
formerly known as the "Domain Awareness Center," will "electronically
gather data around the clock from a variety of sensors and databases,
analyze that data, and display some of the information on a bank of
giant monitors." The Times doesn't detail what kind of "sensors and
databases" the federally funded "port security" project will pay for,
but perhaps it's something like Seattle's mesh network with its ability
to ping, log, and visually map the movement of devices in and out of its
coverage area.

Which brings up some corollary issues, ones with implications much
larger than the SPD's ability to call up a given time on a given day and
see whether you were at work, at home, at someone's else home, at a bar,
or at a political demonstration: What does it mean when money from a
federal agency like the Department of Homeland Security is being
funneled to local police departments like SPD to purchase and use
high-powered surveillance gear?

For federal surveillance projects, the NSA and other federal spying
organizations have at least some oversight?as flawed as it may be?from
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (also known as the FISA
court) and the US Congress. But local law enforcement doesn't have that
kind of oversight and, in Seattle at least, has been buying and
installing DHS-funded surveillance equipment without explaining what
it's up to. The city council's surveillance ordinance earlier this year
was an attempt to provide local oversight on that kind of policing, but
it has proven toothless.

It's reasonable to assume that locally gleaned information will be
shared with other organizations, including federal ones. An SPD diagram
of the mesh network, for example, shows its information heading to
institutions large and small, including the King County Sheriff's
Office, the US Coast Guard, and our local fusion center.

Fusion centers, if you're unfamiliar with the term, are
information-sharing hubs, defined by the Department of Homeland Security
as "focal points" for the "receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing" of
surveillance information.

If federally funded, locally built surveillance systems with little to
no oversight can dump their information in a fusion center?think of it
as a gun show for surveillance, where agencies freely swap information
with little restriction or oversight?that could allow federal agencies
such as the FBI and the NSA to do an end-run around any limitations set
by Congress or the FISA court.

If that's their strategy in Seattle, Oakland, and elsewhere, it's an
ingenious one?instead of maintaining a few high-powered, herculean
surveillance agencies designed to digest an immense amount of traffic
and political scrutiny, the federal government could sprinkle an entire
nation with lots of low-powered surveillance nodes and let them figure
out the best way to route the data by talking to each other. By
diffusing the way the information flows, they can make it flow more
efficiently.

It's an innovative solution?much like the Aruba mesh network itself.

The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for
comment.

You make good points, but the article that collecting device location
information is actually a design of the Aruba system:

"The user's guide for one of Aruba's recent software products states:
"The wireless network has a wealth of information about unassociated and
associated devices." That software includes "a location engine that
calculates associated and unassociated device location every 30 seconds
by default... The last 1,000 historical locations are stored for each
MAC address.""

While collecting IMEI and IMSI data is certainly widespread, tracking
MAC addresses is relevant for devices like tablets and laptops, which
I'm sure the police and feds think is in their interest to track.

I'm not saying it's effective or even well designed, and besides, there
is ample evidence that systems like these and omnipresent police cameras
don't do a damn thing to *prevent* crime or terrorism.

Someone on libtech mentioned that this comes in addition to Seattle's
Trapwire system, ORCA transit pass tracking, license plate readers,
gunshot detectors, port cameras, ubiquitous CCTV, and all the other crap
DHS and co. has placed in every major city in the US like air sniffers.

It's just so sad to see another example of great mesh technology being
put to use in further entrenching the surveillance state.

just my .02

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion-discuss Digest, Vol 14, Issue 5

I had exactly 18 students all simultaneously trying to connect to OwnCloud
a local application hosted on our server not the routers at one time.  I've
had this happen a few random times in the past week or so but only once
throughout the day almost always with the first class I have in the
morning.  The second class to follow had more students and we began the
class repeating the same behavior of connecting to OwnCloud but I did not
have any issues.

I'll ssh into the node tomorrow morning during my first class and see what
commands are running if the node happens to crash.  Also, I know I disabled
the commotion-splash by checking "immediately authenticate" under Captive
Portal but is there another way in command line to completely kill that
process from running all the time?  I just ran top on one of my nodes and I
still see that no-dog splash is running.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Seattle Police mesh network for
	surveillance?
In-Reply-To: <527AFBCC.6050308@opentechinstitute.org>
References: <527AFBCC.6050308@opentechinstitute.org>
Message-ID: <CADSh-SOCbEXA3USnH2fmO39EYP9OC6oK+d4BNSjgkPm5iwOusA@mail.gmail.com>

A mesh backhaul for video cameras, along with miscellaneous data services,
seems the the only probable use for this mesh.

I'm unclear about how dual-band 802.11n outdoor radios can accomplish much
along the lines of meaningful surveillance all by itself, unless the APs
offer unencrypted WiFi with Internet access as a sort of honey pot.  Client
devices like smart phones are indeed sampling the air for whatever SSIDs
are currently in range, but they're not transmitting unless the user
selects an AP connect to, or unless the phones are configured to
automatically associate with open APs.  Is this actually still the default
configuration of most smart phones, or do enough phones still do it to
justify building a $2.7M mesh network to exploit that?

If anything, the decision to use a mesh of small devices with omni dipoles
might indicate some progress.  The police-funded video surveillance system
going up here in St. Louis are relying on gangly rooftop masts studded with
lots of Firetide radios and 2.4GHz panels pointed every which direction,
for what probably eats up more taxpayer $$$ per unit than the Aruba gear
used by the SPD.

Besides, phone tracking is conventionally done using the IMEI; the MAC of
the device's 802.11 chipset is irrelevant.  On the post-Snowden assumption
that any carrier data on your phone's whereabouts can readily be handed
over (or has already been handed over) to nosy intelligence services,
having such a mesh network purpose-built to that end seems redundant.

This post isn't Commotion-specific. However, it touches on a lot of
points on organizing networks and the experience that Detroit Digital
Stewards had in Berlin at the International Summit for Community
Wireless Networks. And it's great.

http://alliedmedia.org/#!/news/2013/11/01/amp-digital-stewards-represent-detroit-international-summit-community-wireless

Note that the Detroit Digital Stewards all went through a 20-week
training program to learn how to build community wireless networks
using Commotion:

As far as I can tell, it uses WiFi (in what way, we don't know) to do
communications between phones, and has some sort of fancy social
networking stuff.

No indications if it will be open source, or if it will provide anything
more or less than the other wifi meshy android apps out there, but I was
curious if anyone knew more about it.

Home Wireless Network Keeps the Snoops Away, by Kate Murphy

Unfortunately, Kate told me all mentions of St. Louis or WasabiNet were

get OTI, Commotion, FNF, etc into the story and make it a better article.

Yeah. The great strength of this article is that it mentions so many
different organizations and networks. It shows that this is a movement,
not just one project. It's too bad WasabiNet doesn't get a mention in
this particular article, but those who know certainly know.

No worries.

The mesh here in St. Louis is on the small side, compared to other
community networks mentioned in the article which are 10x larger, or more.
Also, in the past, sudden, unexpected press exposure has sometimes led to
equally sudden floods of emails and phone calls to effect of "Hey, I live
10 km away, can you put an antenna on my roof tomorrow?" or even more
sinister stuff like "You're breaking the law!"  Maybe it's just a Missouri
thing.

At any rate, I'm just glad I had to opportunity to introduce Kate to OTI,
the wifi summit, FNF, etc.  She was apparently unaware of them before
calling me.

Well, just for the record: I guess I also pointed her towards the same organisations. But it really does not matter.
What matters is that there is a continued interest in our community mesh network topics.
That's *good*.

This is really exciting!  What's truly important is that we all continue to
point reporters to everyone else doing awesome work in this space.  The
interconnections amongst projects and initiatives is what makes our movement
strong and garners interest from the press.

With Commotion gearing up to release v1.0 to ring in the new year, I expect that
we'll be highlighting the work of numerous allies around the globe when
reporters start calling.  We definitely need more leads on projects and
initiatives that are deploying Commotion (by design, we have no way to track
Commotion users, so we don't necessarily know where the technology is being
deployed).

Yeah. The great strength of this article is that it mentions so many
different organizations and networks. It shows that this is a movement,
not just one project. It's too bad WasabiNet doesn't get a mention in
this particular article, but those who know certainly know.

i agree - great this is being seen as a movement.

is anyone else disturbed by the trend towards painting this as a potential threat to national security? you are all a bunch of renegades trying to hide from the NSA?

whether that?s true or not, its an incredibly sensational angle and creates the potential for serious backlash. when i read both of these articles in my mind i immediately saw Verizon lobbyists descending on Trenton with re-prints and legislation blocking mesh networks attached. 

maybe I?m paranoid but this reminds me very much of the days when NYCwireless were being called ?wireless pirates? even though we weren?t doing anything illegal. then Philly, then all the steakhouse bans on muni.

maybe this is not the place for it, but just wanted to raise a counterpoint to all the high-5ing

It's an understandable concern. See this article from last year in
which the CTO of DC has concerns that mesh networking can support the
"terrorist community:"
http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/housingcomplex/2012/01/11/meet-the-new-ish-boss-chief-technology-officer-rob-mancini/

But that's why it is our job to get out in front and tell stories of
how this is beneficial to people and peaceful community - bringing
folks together, supporting communication in times of need, pioneering
innovation platforms outside of the VC pipeline.

Also it was plausible especially in Philly that steakhouses would have

First of all many thanks to all the O.T.I  wonderful persons who contributed 
to organize the IS4CWN 20013 in Berlin.
I had the opportunity to meet ,talk and listen some of you and it was a 
great experience.
I want to mention the moving talk of Virginia Eubanks.
She has really changed my point of view.Thanks again.
Now it is my moment.
I have submitted to the principals of 2 high schools of my own town a 
project to wifi connect the two schools and create a mesh network.
The network entirley created and managed by students.
Of course I'll use Commotion solution.
I had to present the project to the students representatives in the next 
weeks.
I was going to write to this list asking some help.
How can I convince them and give  good reasons to adopt this project and 
show the advantages   compared to the wifi deployed on my town by the 
telephone companies in these days/weeks?
The article "Home Wireless Network Keeps the Snoops Away" is of great help 
to answer the question.
Any other suggestion from your experience?

Luigi

Home Wireless Network Keeps the Snoops Away, by Kate Murphy

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/technology/personaltech/homemade-wireless-networks-keep-the-snoops-away.html

Unfortunately, Kate told me all mentions of St. Louis or WasabiNet were
victims of editing.  Still, she did say my manic name-dropping did help to
get OTI, Commotion, FNF, etc into the story and make it a better article.

(You're welcome ;)

Yeah. The great strength of this article is that it mentions so many
different organizations and networks. It shows that this is a movement,
not just one project. It's too bad WasabiNet doesn't get a mention in
this particular article, but those who know certainly know.

No worries.

The mesh here in St. Louis is on the small side, compared to other
community networks mentioned in the article which are 10x larger, or more.
Also, in the past, sudden, unexpected press exposure has sometimes led to
equally sudden floods of emails and phone calls to effect of "Hey, I live
10 km away, can you put an antenna on my roof tomorrow?" or even more
sinister stuff like "You're breaking the law!"  Maybe it's just a Missouri
thing.

At any rate, I'm just glad I had to opportunity to introduce Kate to OTI,
the wifi summit, FNF, etc.  She was apparently unaware of them before
calling me.

Well, just for the record: I guess I also pointed her towards the same 
organisations. But it really does not matter.
What matters is that there is a continued interest in our community mesh 
network topics.
That's *good*.

This is really exciting!  What's truly important is that we all continue to
point reporters to everyone else doing awesome work in this space.  The
interconnections amongst projects and initiatives is what makes our movement
strong and garners interest from the press.

With Commotion gearing up to release v1.0 to ring in the new year, I expect 
that
we'll be highlighting the work of numerous allies around the globe when
reporters start calling.  We definitely need more leads on projects and
initiatives that are deploying Commotion (by design, we have no way to track
Commotion users, so we don't necessarily know where the technology is being
deployed).

Here is the Mother Jones article being mentioned.  First time I saw it.
http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/08/mesh-internet-privacy-nsa-isp

An obvious weakness to this premise of using neighhorhood-wide mesh
networks to preserve privacy is that the underlying reliance on
*wireless*makes the task of eavesdropping just that much easier.  I
believe this is
what Julian Priest was explicitly warning about during his surprise talk at
the Berlin summit last month.

Plus, very few community meshes that provide Internet access are not able
to do much more than the "last mile," meaning they still rely on
conventional telcos in one form or another for their uplinks, just at
somewhat higher levels than individuals.

Better integration of VPN layers could indeed help reduce the vulnerability
to eavesdropping, although that would very likely incur unappealing
performance penalties.  However, there is still the fact you're actively
broadcasting all your data, for any adequately equipped parties (whether
you want them to be or not) to listen in.  This isn't unique, we already do
this compulsively with mobile phones.

I would hope that this current trend of framing community mesh networks as
tools again surveillance doesn't eclipse the parallel motivation of also
building such meshes for economic reasons.  And likewise that it doesn't
distract from the deployment of adhoc meshes during emergencies.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Interesting discussion on WISPA listserv about
	the cable ISP hotspots
Message-ID: <CADSh-SMweLcfZ4n8F==1JQFc-HZ4RXR1D1mODgAvhX3E7BgLOg@mail.gmail.com>

There is an interesting discussion going on right now on the WISPA listserv
(Wireless Internet Service Provider Association) about the hotspots being
hung on coax lines by US cable ISPs like Comcast, Time Warner, etc to
distribute service via 802.11 to existing subscribers.

This was brought about by Comcast's recent appeal to the FCC to free up
more of the 5.GHz band for more "unlicensed" use (aka so they can use the
band for cheaper):
http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/comcast-testifies-to-congress-today-in-support-of-gigabit-wi-fi-2
http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/496570-Comcast_to_Congress_Freeing_Up_More_5_GHZ_WiFi_Spectrum_Is_Crucial.php?rssid=20065

The WISPA discussion archive is only visible to list members, but those
interested should be able to subscribe here:
http://lists.wispa.org/mailman/listinfo/wireless

The actual hotspot being deployed is a product made by Ruckus, which
apparently retails for a thrifty 5000$US.

Much of the discussion on the WISPA lists includes concern over the cable
operators' apparent apathy over the spectrum pollution they cause (possibly
in 2.4GHz *and* 5.8GHz) by scattering these devices all over creation.  It
would seem that ensuring appropriate TX power levels, so that even the
cable operators' own subscribers get good connection to the APs, may not be
a high priority. :(

A potential upshot is that the very high price for the Ruckus unit could be
used by listmembers here for their own funding applications, to the effect
of, "the cable company pays $5000 for just one of their fancy hotspots!
The same funds could build a mesh across this entire block."  Member of the
WISPA list have already jumped on this very fact, too.

Is there any way to regulate that kind of hardware and noise pollution
at the local level?

I believe the nature of FCC certification of unlicensed devices is that the
devices (and their users) have to tolerate potentially destructive
interference.  This could mean that operator(s) of unlicensed devices may
chose to configure their radios so as to render the spectrum unusable (even
by their own radios), whether by intention or by negligence, that being
their prerogative.

Things like HAM and military radar will indeed impose external restrictions
on where/when unlicensed devices may be used, but as long as any device is
not broadcasting above the TX power limit stipulated in its certification,
there is nothing bodies like the FCC would be empowered or inclined to do.

I would like to think there are some paths available for lodging complaints
about poor spectrum usage by specific parties, even for unlicensed bands,
but I'm fairly certain those paths would be steeply uphill.

No, not federal, obviously. I'm thinking more like using design
standards or noise pollution. Has anyone got creative there?

See http://banc.nextweb.net/ for one example of a wireless spectrum 
network coordination working group... i think there are other similar 
ones.

Unfortunately, those actors most empowered to ensure optimal spectrum use
in this discussion, namely regulatory agencies like the FCC, cable
operators, and the chipset manufacturers, are also probably going to be the
least responsive to community-based concerns.  This will place burden on
small scale WISPs, community meshes, and other groups dependent on
unlicensed spectrum for their backhaul, to be especially attentive to their
antenna gain and local noise floor, i.e. to better cut through the noise.

Short of any options for lodging complaints with the FCC, should certain
cable operators prove to be especially disruptive in their deployment of
hotspots, one possibility may be to seek partnership with organizations
like WISPA in bending the ear of regulators.  WISPA's membership dues
mostly go toward to hiring a lobbyist or two, for precisely these scenarios.

And when Obama hits the internet switch.. "Drat..it won't  work on
Commotion.... deploy the EMP drones!" jk

 I second the VPN but it isn't usually easy to set up maybe there is an
alternative software.

We need a free open source 100% secure proxy/gateway we can set all of the
routers to that connect to the internet. Anyone have one?

I agree 100% that there is a demonization of these efforts and it spans all
emergent technologies that are posing challenges to centralized modes of
governance and production.  This is why I am working from the angle of
emergency response-  if we can get mesh networks out there that literally
save lives when big telcos and governments fail, then it will serve as
effective public diplomacy.  This is why, among many reasons, I love the
Red Hook project.

I am.
I don't see myself as a renegade. Rather more of a researcher in this field.

Well it is clear that the journalist created a sensationalist article, put us all into one box and said "they work against NSA spying". Of course that is B*S.
I am not worried about any backlash, but I am disturbed that my quotation ended up in an article which has an overall message that I can not sign up to. 
Currently, these mesh networks would not be secure against any serious attack whatsoever. Nor would the users of these networks be able to handle any targeted attack.
The article is not only sensationalist but also technically wrong.

Not sure what disturbs me more.

Message-ID: <CAKxU6K03su5__QM=qCL8ZPk-i5n2zU3tv3gOgT4hsptyHCUBrg@mail.gmail.com>

I had been using 1 Pico station in my computer lab which has at the minimum
24 clients using that node at one time.

To balance out the load/ to prevent that node from crashing I added another
Pico Station to the lab. However I am having issues with clients all
connecting to one node continuing the crashing. Is there anyway to
configure my lab so half of my clients connect to one node and the other
half to other to connect to other node?  All of the PC's are running
windows 7 which I think is making it more difficult to assign them to a
specific bssid.

I'm delurking to comment on this a bit (hi everyone!).

I have to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed that the tenor on this list
would be to fall right in line with the idea that anyone who doesn't want
all of their Internet traffic captured, stored, and analyzed by the NSA is
therefore a "renegade." Setting aside the technical mistakes of the article
(I can think of nothing in the Commotion software that would protect you
much from pervasive surveillance), I would hope that at least some people
here WOULD be thinking about how we can begin using the Commotion stack to
greater protect users from unwarranted surveillance. Why is that not the
case?

I think that was a misunderstanding. Nobody suggested that IMHO.

> Setting aside the technical mistakes of the article (I can think of nothing in the Commotion software that would protect you much from pervasive surveillance), I would hope that at least some people here WOULD be thinking about how we can begin using the Commotion stack to greater protect users from unwarranted surveillance. Why is that not the case?


I think you need to distinguish between the fact that some voices on this list said they don't like the sensationalist spin of the article vs. the fact that we (well many of us at least) *do* care a lot about privacy, user's rights and IT security. In fact the latter is even my day time job. 

Fact: our community mesh networks will *not* protect anyone in the world at the moment against targeted surveillance or hacking.
Fact: good IT security is really hard. Like, really really hard. Google tried to secure their systems, but it was so easy to p0wn them from multiple angles (given enough money to buy fiber taps).
Fact: many of us are trying hard to make IT security better and uphold principles of privacy.


However, that does not make it our community wireless mesh networks automatically resistant against snooping ("keep the snoops away"). In fact, Wi-Fi is a broadcast medium. They just need a good antenna ;-)
Suggesting in the article that they are secure is a massive oversimplification - actually just simply plain false.


In fact, I'd love to see NSA folks do some code reviews of COMMOTION / OLSR. I would know of no better qualified group of folks to do such a thing.
Alas, you might also get a backdoor this way (as we have seen with NIST).
Too bad. Really talented people. 

My 2 cents,
a.

Hi all,

We are very well situated to push back on the inevitable national security
concerns -- FWIW, this is not a new phenomenon and dates back at least to 2005.
 What's crucial is that we continue to push out the positive angles of the work
we do -- we support low-cost connectivity, human rights workers and democracy
advocates, community empowerment, freedom of expression, Internet Freedom, etc.
 And let's not get distracted by intractable arguments.

I counter the argument by saying that Commotion is an incredibly powerful tool,
much like a computer or a pencil.  And like any powerful tool, there's a tiny
pool of people that will use it for malfeasance; however, the overall,
remarkable positive impacts on society writ large make it a no-brainer that we
should do everything we can to support R&D and adoption of these technologies.

hear hear. sorry i stirred up a hornet?s nest. 

i?ve just been astonished, as i wade back into community wireless after a ten-year hiatus, how little of the strategic landscape seems to have changed. and in many ways (esp around surveillance) has gotten worse. just kind of rolling with my hunches, i guess.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Why is decentralizing the internet so hard?
Message-ID: <522344CD.6080902@opentechinstitute.org>

Interesting article laying out many of the challenges of decentralizing
the internet, and what led to the centralized structure of the internet
in the first place:
http://blog.zerotier.com/post/58157836374/op-ed-internet-centralization-is-not-a-conspiracy

"If you want to help decentralize the net, you might consider working on
better security tooling for developers or software to help manage
decentralized and deperimeterized enterprise networks."

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Mesh Networking Teaching Curriculum
Message-ID: <5224D2D8.4030707@abaarsotech.org>

Howdy everyone,

I'm in the process of starting a computer club at the boarding school
where I teach in Somaliland. The overall goal is to teach interested
students about mesh networking as well as Commotion.  I was wondering if
anyone had any decent videos,graphics or simple explanations of how mesh
networking works. I've found a video put out by the Berkman School of
Internet and Society but have not found much else on the simple side. 
If anyone has anything to point me in the right direction I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Dan

Hi Dan-


I did just the same thing last Spring where I work, the John Dewey Academy in Mass.  I wrote an initial blog post about it here:  www.zapatalab.com


My students are in the 16 - 19 y.o. range.  I am the social sciences teacher, but I was  political organizer for years and had some expertise with MySQL and basic web design (setting up LAMP platforms, Drupal, Wordpress, etc).  In spite of my relative lack of tech experience, I have been able to lead the students and they have largely taught themselves.  Some students have more expertise than others, and that has been a big help, but overall I think the project can be replicated just about anywhere.  


So far we have built and a maintained a school-wide mesh network using TP Link routers and B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol, we call it DeweyNet-  it serves as an intranet.  We also created a Linux server with a document cloud (OwnCloud), phpbb (bulletin board), Red Mine (project management), and a wiki.  It?s been up and running for about 5 months now.

 

Right now we are beta testing Raspberry PI-based routers, access points and servers for a completely off-the-grid system.  I am developing a game based on a zombie apocalypse scenario that will teach folks to put up emergency communications systems   I will post more of the documentation for you on the blog.


We?ve managed to do all of this so far with +/- $800.  


Best regards-

Evan

Not sure what the call trace is all about. Are you having connectivity
problems? If so, what are the symptoms? Can you give info on:
* What device you are using
* What version of Commotion you are using
* Did you build Commotion from source

The 'WARNING' message comes from the wireless driver.

I get that chan.c warning message from time to time with UBNT Nanostation M
radios (and I think also sporadically on TL-MR3020) using the ath9k driver.

This warning doesn't appear to affect connectivity for me, and it seems to
occur most commonly when I issue "wifi restart" command.  There is mention
of similar warnings from the mac80211 driver stack on various threads on
OpenWRT-devel listserv, so this might just be an ongoing issue with OpenWRT.

Also, I have so far only verified Commotion's multi-SSID setup works on
ath9k, ath5k, and ath9k_htc drivers (with the latter only supporting *2
SSIDs*, i.e. adhoc + 1 AP).  What hardware are you using?

That's pretty cool Evan - do you have any more documentation or
information on how the installation and setup the DeweyNet went with the
students? It sounds really great!

Dan and everyone - OTI will be releasing some of our "Commotion
Construction Kit" modules very soon. It will have a lot of information
and guides on how to plan and build networks, and will be expanding as
time goes on.

As soon as the guides are ready, we will be sure to send an announcement
to this list.

Message-ID: <CAOuqqRmRsrfWQctUc5+ANgZL-ShXswT-fgjsRSOp+5M8amfJGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,
I am very intrigued by Commotion and am very anxious to try and learn about
it as well as maybe help where I can once I learn more about Commotion
itself.  I have four ubiquiti picostation2hp's and would love to use them
as a test before purchasing the newer models.  I tried compiling the
firmware myself and it stated it compiled but the picostation reports a
corrupt firmware and won't load it.  Does anyone have a compiled version of
commotion that will work the picostation2hp's?  I truly appreciate your
help in advance.

Thanks,

Frank

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] How do you factory reset a Rocket?
Message-ID: <CAJw8ZXk2baUtBj+OPGURc+WOPAad89OJf7jiigBtCk+1igxmNw@mail.gmail.com>

This may seem like an asinine question but I'm stumped.

We lucked into 5 Rockets (M2's and M5's!) last week and I'm trying to reset
them to factory defaults. As anyone who has played with ubnt routers knows,
they're finicky about resetting.

What is the actual, honest-to-goodness, guaranteed-to-work way to factory
reset a Ubiquiti Rocket WITHOUT LOGGING IN? I have watched every video on
the web concerning this and read all Ubiquiti's documentation. Doesn't help.

Here's what I do:
Device is off. I hold the reset button in. I power on the device. Releasing
after 8 seconds is supposed to put it in TFTP mode. Releasing after 15
seconds resets it completely.

The thing is, neither of these amount of times actually resets it and I
can't ping it when the lights are blinking 1 and 3 then 2 and 4. Upon power
cycling the router, the old SSID pops up on my wifi network monitor. It's
been rather frustrating. Can anyone shed some light on how to reset a
Ubiquiti rocket without logging in and resetting it?

Thank you!

Adam L.

I've generally been able to put my Rocket M into TFTP/recover mode by
holding down the reset button upon power-up for at least 15seconds.

If you are able to get the unit into TFTP mode (i.e. it responds to ping at
address 192.168.1.20), you can effect a factory reset by then simply
uploading an image to reflash it, whether with stock UBNT firmware or
OpenWRT/Commotion.

When I put it into tftp I CANNOT ping it, which I find rather odd. set
myself to static: 192.168.1.10 with 255.255.255.0 but the ping requests
timeout. I'm having this problem with 4 seperate routers that all produce
SSIDs when booted normally.

Any idea why this is and what's causing it? It should be super simple to
flash them but... I can't even reach them in TFTP mode.

I'd suggest setting your IP to 192.168.1.42. At least theoretically,
that's the only IP that the M-series devices respond to in TFTP mode.

If by "router" you mean you're plugging both your laptop/desktop and the
Rocket into an intermediate Ethernet switch or router, that shouldn't be
necessary.  I just use a regular patch cable between the LAN port on my
Laptop and the "LAN" jack on the UBNT POE injector.  The UBNT's auto-sense
polarity on their LAN ports, I believe.  No cross-over cables needed.

Also, do note that UBNT recommends setting yourself to address
192.1681.254, so the rocket in TFTP mode may only accept incoming packets
from that address.

Indeed it was asinine. Problem solved. Tftp mode is obtained by starting
with the power off and holding reset for 8 seconds as you power up the
rocket. Factory reset is achieved by letting the device boot normally then
holding reset button for 15 seconds. Works like a charm!

Message-ID: <CAOuqqRkgnwuzn37f+_pwzuVMKjpSvL=ckQyG1nEbiaWHwDcyhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,
I am very intrigued by Commotion and am very anxious to try and learn about
it as well as maybe help where I can once I learn more about Commotion
itself.  I have four ubiquiti picostation2hp's and would love to use them
as a test before purchasing the newer models.  I tried compiling the
firmware myself and it stated it compiled but the picostation reports a
corrupt firmware and won't load it.  Does anyone have a compiled version of
commotion that will work the picostation2hp's?  I truly appreciate your
help in advance.

Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank. Can't say I've ever built Commotion for the 2hp. Can you give 
some details about the corruption message you saw?

If memory serves, and you are not referring to a Picostation 2M, the Pico
2HP is an ath5k-based radio like the FONera.  However, I believe it only
has 4Mbytes of flash and 16Mbytes of RAM.  Commotion-OpenWRT wouldn't be
able to run on this device at all.

I've compiled older versions of Commotion-OpenWRT for atheros platform to
run on Engenius EOC-1650 and Open Mesh OM1P, albeit with several ugly
patches to work-around missing GPIO support (i.e. the status LEDs don't
work).  Although, I do not have any recent images handy.

The 2HP has 32mb of RAM and 8mb flash size with some kind of Atheros
chipset, so hopefully it will able to run Commotion.[1]

This datasheet says it has 8MB flash, so it should probably work w/

Aha, my only experience with the ath5k-generation UBNT radios was the
Nanostation and Bullet, which only had 16MB of RAM.

Anyhoo, the Picostation 2HP would correspond to the "atheros" platform (aka
ath5k driver) under OpenWRT, and it will not run the ar71xx images at all.
You would need to compile Commotion-OpenWRT for the atheros platform.

Also, I can furthermore confirm the current generation of OpenWRT Attitude
Adjustment has something wrong with its kernel-level GPIO support that
prevents images from booting on atheros platform, at least on the Engenius
and Open Mesh radios I've tested.  The OpenWRT-devel community hasn't
devoted any effort to fixing this (and they possibly won't, due to these
devices' age).

I've no idea if the broken GPIO support also prevents OpenWRT AA from
booting on Picstation 2HP.  You may need to try flashing AA (i.e. regular
OpenWRT, not Commotion-OpenWRT) on the device first to see if it boots.

Thanks to Adam and Dan's guidelines I have arrived at a good point .
My HTC Desire is rooted,Clockworkmod is installed.
I have installed a patch to enable the ad-hoc mode on my mobile and I 
have installed  CommotionMeshTether-pr3.apk .

The ad-hoc mode works but only with WEP or no-security.
No WAP/WAP2.
It could be a problem of the patch?
Any suggestion to overcome this?
I want to see my HTC connected as a node of the the commotion mesh !

Last comment.When I run Mesh Tether the default ip address is 10.xxx and 
not 5.xx as I was expecting.

Luigi

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion Splash Screen
Message-ID: <5231A848.3060307@abaarsotech.org>

Yesterday we had our first large internet outage since setting up our
first few commotion nodes.  I have our homepage in the our computer lab
set to google.com but since we are on an open network the commotion
splash screen comes up first.  This is great since it makes it easier
for students to access local applications without having to memorize the
location of the applications on the network. 

However, when our net went out the splash screen did not come up.  I was
wondering if anyone knew a way to set the splash screen so it will come
up regardless if their is internet access. Should the splash screen
appear anyway regardless and am I'm missing something in the captive
portal settings? Is there way to set the splash screen as a homepage?

Also, I've noticed that some students who are running older versions of
Firefox and chrome in windows 7 would not be redirected to the splash
screen and could not access the internet.  After updating their browsers
we seemed to get to the splash screen fine to allow internet access. Not
sure if this has been a problem in the past or of I'm missing something
as well.

Any guidance or help would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

Dan

Hi Dan,

Unfortunately, the splash screen currently requires internet access to
function. This is because the captive portal program intercepts and
modifies responses to clients' DNS requests, and those responses only
occur if DNS servers are available in the first place. With no internet
access, no DNS response, no splash screen.

I have worked on creating a captive portal solution for
non-internet-connected Commotion networks, and it in fact works. The
problem is that there is currently no way to have a router auto-detect
whether it is currently connected to the internet or not, and then
auto-configure its captive portal to do the right thing. If your network
suffered an internet outage, you would have to either restart DNSmasq on
each node, or reboot all the nodes, in order for the splash screen to
continue to function. And then do the same thing once internet access
was restored.

There might be a way to run a script periodically to check for internet
connectivity, and then restart DNSmasq if it detects an outage. I'll try
to work on that and see what I can do.

Do you know what versions of Firefox and Chrome didn't work with the
splash page? If you can find out, I can look into that too.

cheers,
Dan

For now, we just need a way to let people know there is a
splash/community/apps page right?

Perhaps access points should be named "go to x" so that people would
have some idea of where to go?

Hi All,

Is nodogsplash still being investigated as a stand-alone splash page
solution?  My understanding is that nodog would intercept users' port 80
sessions before any DNS queries were actually launched.

I realize the version of nodog available until just recently was lacking
key bandwidth throttling features, but I can share that a new nodog was
released a few days ago.  The Changelog, unfortunately, doesn't indicate
that throttling has yet been ported to the new 3.x kernel.
https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/releases/tag/v0.9_beta9.9.8

Anyway, on the old ROBIN firmware, the nodog captive portal would indeed
continue to display even in case of Internet outage, since the portal
content is stored locally on the node.  I had used that very capability to
(manually) adjust content on nodes' local splash page and announce
outages.  This unfortunately didn't work out as a reliable means to
announce outages, since the ROBIN firmware itself would later detect the
Internet outage and disable the nodes' AP entirely (a feature which
couldn't be disabled, and got annoying very quickly).

As for a node detecting whether it has Internet access, I think Freifunk
scripted solution for that in the freifunk-gwcheck package.  Unfortunately,
luci,subsignal.org appears to be down now, so I can't cite the source code.

This appears to be clone:

But that instruction would only make sense if the Internet was down and
the splash page wasn't working, right? So it's another node-by-node
adjustment you would have to make after an outage.

If I understand it correctly, you would still be able to get to a
locally-hosted page or service by entering in the IP address, so we'd
have to socialize an emergency IP address for people to enter in advance
of an Internet outage, the way people in the US know to dial 911 in case
of emergency. Or is that not how it would work?

The captive portal can't intercept port 80 requests before DNS requests
because the client doesn't actually make a port 80 HTTP request until
they get a DNS resolution of the site they are trying to reach.

I would be really curious to know how ROBIN captive portaled during
internet outages.

Hi Dan,

I believe ROBIN's trick was to include local hostname entries for the
router, e.g. my.open-mesh.com, in into the node's dnsmasq config.

Likewise, dnsmasq supports storing a local cache on the node, which could
be enhanced/enlarged to ensure a good chance that a commonly requested URLs
(google.com, yahoo.com, etc) has entries in the local cache.  Indeed, the
local cache could also be explicitly seeded on power-up with such popular
entries.  I don't believe the RAM requirements for 150 entries vs 10000
entries in the local DNS cache are that severe.

This might allow nodogsplash to stand a good chance of successfully caching
users' port 80 sessions in the event of an Internet outage and display an
appropriate portal page (e.g. announcement of the outage).

This approach would assume the node normally has an Internet connection,
and that outages are infrequent.

clients to access the router. But I'm not sure how that would be useful
for captive portaling.

I also wasn't aware of dnsmasq's caching abilities. I'll have to look
into that. If you have any suggestions for best utilizing it or seeding
it, I would love to know.

thanks,
Dan

Thanks for the feedback. I've installed gw-check just have no idea how I
could write a script to have it work with dnsmasq so everytime there is
an outage dnsmasq would restart. 

How might I go about adding local entries to the dnsmasq config? Our
outages are fairly infrequent so maybe this is a good solution.

I'll look into what versions of chrome/Firefox were giving me trouble.
Not positive but I think it may have been with versions 20 or 21.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] HTC desire Android 2.3.3 rooted and setting
 in ad-hoc mode(no internet connection)

Message-ID: <5235CEF6.4080201@fastwebnet.it>


Purpose of this test was to verify internet connection of my android 
phone in mesh mode through the internet gateway of my network.
*Setup:* 2  Picostations flashed with default Commotion, 1android (HTC 
Desire) ,1 Linux DeskTop.
N01 Picostation as  internet gateway via ethernet cable on LAN port.


Setting.
-Android :rooted ,ad-hoc mode active,no-encryption,IP static 5.x.x.x.
-Picostations :Both with no-encryption.
-Linuk Desktop:no-encryption,commotion mesh applet used to set wifi card.

No problems with LinuxDesktop.I can connect to internet and the 
applet(mesh status view ,debug log) works well.

Android.
The mesh tether looks like described somewhere in the commotion web site.
I can visualize the link window with  three neighbors,LQ status,NLQ 
status and the gateway icon.
The info window reports the same wifi setting as in the active profile.
Ping works with all the nodes an I can connect the phone to the 
administration page of both Picostation.

BUT.
I couldn't connect Android phone  to Internet in mesh mode.
Absolutely no way.
(in infrastructure mode I can connect and I see the commotion splash 
screen).

Where I was wrong?

Thanks.

Luigi

But that instruction would only make sense if the Internet was down and
the splash page wasn't working, right? So it's another node-by-node
adjustment you would have to make after an outage.

If I understand it correctly, you would still be able to get to a
locally-hosted page or service by entering in the IP address, so we'd
have to socialize an emergency IP address for people to enter in advance
of an Internet outage, the way people in the US know to dial 911 in case
of emergency. Or is that not how it would work?

Hi Tim,

Maybe someone else here has some ideas, but I'd say that's a great
question to ask the olsrd-dev list:

Thanks Josh and Ryan -- those were my thoughts too. If we are talking about
Commotion's use-case as an intra-net without dependency on global Internet
access, then not having the splash page appear unless there is connectivity
seems like a problem -- but hopefully a problem with an easy solution?

If I am building a network with Commotion on which Internet is an
occasional added bonus, how do people access the network/the local apps
without going to the splashpage?

Hey Tim,

I also think talking to the OLSR list would be the way to go if you are
only interested in protocol level interventions against DOS attacks.

I also recommend reading (Kim, Yu-seung, and Lee Heejo " On Classifying
and Evaluating the Effects of Jamming Attacks") which I have found
useful in my explorations of denial of service attacks. You may also
find something useful in the OLD bibliography I put together for my
threat modelling work.

Try the Bullet firmware! Last time I checked they were compatible (the M versions of Bullet and Picostation).

I'm currently suffering some odd browser issues, so I can't fetch a link, but I bet you can find your way to the official firmware download page .)

I thought picostations used the 'atheros' driver and not the 'ath9k' 
driver.  But I don't know what I did with my picostations, so I can't 
confirm.

They do, and I corrected myself in a response which apparently has been 
held in moderation queue because I attached a compiled .bin (as well as 
the config for it).

But Andrew Reynolds has been very helpful in another part of this thread 
already to declare how to build even the DR2 for older picostations, 
from what I saw when reading his posts.

TL;DR? http://a.ludw.se/~mmn/commotion/pico-old/ -> .bin file, OpenPGP
signature by the same key as this mail.

Otherwise here's what I wrote in the last mail, that's stuck in
mod-queue, slightly modified regarding attachments:

Pardon my last mail, I thought the "HP" model was the "M" model.
Nevertheless, I _have_ managed to compile a somewhat working image for
the older, 180MHz, Picostation 2.4Ghz models. I have experienced
problems with it (such as I can't route to 192.168.1.20 when connected
to it, it may not be as stable in the long run, it's of course slower
etc... but it does do the mesh dance!)

The most important part for building for that platform is making a
proper .config, which is attached and also mentioned further down in
this mail.

The OpenPGP-signed binary openwrt-atheros-ubnt2-pico2-squashfs.bin
couldn't be attached to the mailing list without moderation queue, but
it can be downloaded from: http://a.ludw.se/~mmn/commotion/pico-old/

The md5sum of the .bin should be d312ae227697d2956fa82e3389acce67 and
the signature by my key-id F15FF9EE (which is the same as for this mail).


I can't really remember exactly what changes I had to make in the build
config, so I'm attaching what I remember to be from my latest successful
build (at 8th of July).

Last commit in git for the commotion directory was
111c8cc5b1f2d0af5ab8ba9c23388a2dc71ee427 which seems to reference, in
openwrt/feeds.conf:
src-svn packages svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/branches/packages_12.09 at 36405

If you're trying to build yourself, try the latest versions of
everything and simply replace the 'config' (which gets copied to
openwrt/.config) with my attached pico2_.config


As mentioned, this was compiled at the 8th of July 2013. Maybe
referenced repository trees have been updated since then and fail to
build. Let me know if there are any such problems :)

Hi All,

I'm writing briefly to the commotion-discussion list, in follow-up to
recent threads about compiling / obtaining Commotion-OpenWRT firmware for
platforms beside Ubiquiti devices.

I've successfully compiled Commotion for atheros and x86 devices in the
past, and I've done my best to regurgitate that experience into prose form
here:

https://code.commotionwireless.net/projects/commotion/wiki/Custom-Compile-OpenWRT

Please direct further discussion about compiling Commotion over to
commotion-dev list.

Hi All,

Following up on this thread since I recently posted instructions for
compiling Commotion-OpenWRT for older platforms like atheros here:

Here's a DR2 config file based on these instructions. I don't have a
pico 2 to test on but it should be pretty close.

Hi!

Forwarding. Musti does really great things and is searching for some
guidance about possible grants he could apply to to continue with
development.

Subject: KORUZA for organic growth of wireless optical networks
To: "development at wlan-si.net" <development at wlan-si.net>


Dear all,

I am happy to introduce the development of a wireless optical network
system KORUZA.

KORUZA is an innovative open-source open-hardware wireless
communication system, employing a new low-cost approach to designing
free-space optical network systems, enabling building-to-building
connectivity with a highly collimated light beam at a capacity of 1
Gbps (1000 Mbps) at distances up to 100 m. It is designed to be
suitable for home as well as professional users, enabling organic
bottom-up growth of networks by eliminating the need for wired fiber
connections and associated high installation costs. The simplicity of
use, low-cost and compact size allow the system to be deployed in any
network.

Feel free to see a more detailed description of the project with nice
diagrams at:
http://koruza.net

As well as some details about the current state of the prototype system:
http://koruza.net/Prototype

I have written a scientific paper on the topic: Reintroducing
Free-Space Optical Technology to Community Wireless Networks, which is
available on (unfortunately behind a paywall):
http://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2013/ISUsage/RoundTablePresentations/3/

The paper will hopefully be presented to wider audience on AMCIS2013
conference in Chicago this August, but am at the moment lacking
sufficient travel funding to attending it. You are most kindly invited
to forward the project to any organisation that would be able to
support me.

KORUZA is under active development, but at the moment with my personal
resources in Slovenia. The next months are going to be dedicated to
evolve the prototype into a product suitable for the everyone to use
and I am looking forward to presenting it in Berlin in October,
hopefully along with a crowd-funding campaign for the first series. A
lot of work, time and resources are required for the project to grow
up sufficiently to support itself. I am appealing to you for help in
obtaining a grant, by puting me in touch with suitable organisations
or individuals, that will enable the project to continue and meet the
above described goals.

Kind regards,

We actually just did a phone interview with a technologist candidate who
used to work on this same technology with the US navy.

Yes. Free Space Optics is hugely important. 

The Free Network Foundation will be incorporating this technology into FreedomTower.

We will be working on getting a 100mbps/1000 meter version (which is inverse of the koruza system). 

I've put an inquiry into the list, and hope to produce some units stateside at the local hackerspace.

My apologies for sending this to the wrong listserv initially ...

A friend pointed me to this Kickstarter for LibraryBox:

"LibraryBox is an anonymous fileserver based on cheap hardware that runs on
little power and serves files to any wifi-enabled device with a browser. It
is a fork of the Open Source project PirateBox, altered to be more
comfortable to use for libraries, educators, and anyone else that has a
need to serve files in locations that lack reliable, unfiltered
connectivity with the Internet."

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/griffey/librarybox-20
http://librarybox.us/

The photo suggests a TP-Link TL-MR3020 or TL-WN703N, indeed with an
itty-bitty flash drive in the USB jack.

Likewise, I'm about to deploy my 2nd TL-MR3020 as a repeater node for
WasabiNet, having finally squeezed enough of the firmware into 4MB to get
mesh + AP + coovachilli all onboard.

It is neat to see a low-cost platform like the TL-MR3020, whose intended
use as "3G travel modem" is kinda worthless, but which nevertheless enables
quite a diversity of community wifi projects.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion meshing between DR1(Red Hook) and PR2,
	web speed vs. ping speed
Message-ID: <CALxwjyDZc3n0mCp5Fn8XEd6iAMpVt+dNy4+QWka5oOWTXaAqqw@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday evening I updated the software on a node in Mount Pleasant
to DR1 (specifically the Red Hook build), the first update past PR3 in
Mount Pleasant.

The node I updated is a gateway node (connected to a Sprint Clearwire
modem), and it meshes with a node on a community center down the
street which runs PR2 (!)

After updating everything, I checked some speeds. The web speed test
connected to the gateway node only gave about 1.3 Mbps down, but it
functioned fine. I then SSHed in to the gateway node and ran a ping
test from it - average of 116 ms to ping out to 8.8.8.8.

>From there I SSH'ed through the mesh to the node on top of the
community center and pinged 8.8.8.8 from it. It got an average of
about 135 ms out. The average ETX between the two was 1.3.

But when we went down to the community center and associated with its
node, the splash page took forever to resolve. After clicking through
it, no web page would finish resolving. I could ping out to 8.8.8.8
from my laptop while associated, but it varied wildly between 1 s and
90 ms.

My thought is that it is just old buggy software that needs to be
updated - I just wanted to share in case folks thought there might be
something else going on.

Thanks for the info. Did you check the ETX value b/w them when you were
associated with the community center node? Or maybe it was environmental
interference...

How do you test web speed?

Do you use a 3rd-party service like speedtest.net?  If so, you may need to
first check that your ISP's connection to speedtest.net itself isn't having
speed issues.

Likewise, you can try multiple 3rd-party speedtest sites, e.g.
http://speakeasy.net/speedtest

Detroit and Brooklyn, the training tools developed there, and sharing those
tools and Commotion technology with folks at a workshop in India.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Visualizing internet traffic routing
Message-ID: <51F191F3.3040601@opentechinstitute.org>

In presentations about Commotion, we have talked about how traffic is
routed on the internet when you want to send your neighbor a message.
Often, the traffic is routed through servers and switches in different
cities far away, and this is of course unnecessary and inefficient.
Conversely, wireless mesh allows you to send messages in a much more
efficient and direct route.

I just came across this video by IXmaps: http://vimeo.com/67102223. I am
thinking IXmaps might be a good tool for us to use in presentations, to
actually show the visuals of how internet traffic is routed, compared to
routing over a local mesh. For most folks, how the internet is actually
architected is a mystery, and perhaps something like this would be a
good way to get people to really understand it.

Hey,

I think that is a great idea. Concrete examples on how data currently
works, and will be transformed by mesh is a missing piece in the puzzle.

It'd be good for us to add to the curriculum resources too. Right now we
show "The Internet is Serious Business," but this video is really clear
about why that matters!

Great find Dan.

@Dan I checked the ETX while associated with the gateway node, but not
the community center node - I (wrongly) assumed it would be about the
same as before.

@Ben I used speedtest.net, will try others next time.

I have a follow-up to this:

Lacking the admin password to the community center node
(MtPCWN_Paloma), I SSHed in and used the command line to upload the
sysupgrade DR1 Red Hook image to its /tmp directory and updated it
that way. When the node came back online, it had clearly updated the
software. Also:

- It brought up the open RHIWiFi AP, as the Red Hook image tells it
to, but I could never associate with this with either my laptop or my
phone even though I was clearly within range,
- It deleted the MtPCWN_Paloma open AP, but kept the
MtPCWN_Paloma_secure AP online (also couldn't associate with this),
- It brought back up the commotionwireless.net mesh BSSID, but even
though I didn't go through Quickstart and the Red Hook image doesn't
encrypt this, it wasn't associated with the gateway node and I
couldn't get out to the Internet. I tested that by plugging in via
Ethernet.

Now I have the admin password and I plan to go back this evening to
try and finish this. Do you think the problem with not being able to
associate with the AP has to do with upgrading from a late version of
PR2 via the sysupgrade image? Should I flash the factory image, and is
there a way to do this without having to use TFTP mode (that would be
really difficult in this case)?

Thanks for the help,

Preston

Since it kept  the old AP SSID, it sounds like when you upgraded, you 
did the equivalent of checking the "Save settings" checkbox when 
upgrading via the web interface (I haven't flashed via command-line, so 
I'm not sure how that works). In other words, it didn't overwrite the 
settings when you upgraded it, which needs to happen. I can almost 
guarantee that's why you can't associate with the AP, as something 
similar has happened to me before. I would recommend next time to 
upgrade it via the web interface, and make sure the "Save settings" box 
is unchecked.

Let us know how things go!

So I can do this with the sysupgrade image and all should be fine?

Yup, there is no functional difference between sysupgrade and factory 
images.

Hi Jack,

I went yesterday to test out the router again, with my laptop and with
a phone. (I did make the only available access point the open
MtPCWN_Paloma, so that's ok).

I associated with the access point easily, but the router wouldn't
serve me the splash screen on my laptop. It took a long time on my
phone, and when I clicked through to the internet, it just kept
spinning trying to get me to a webpage. I unplugged and re-plugged the
router and the same problem happened.

I'm not sure what the problem is there - I hope that it's something
that will not happen all the time. I'm putting word in to the
commotion-discuss list to see if they can provide any insight.

After a further chat with Preston, this seems like it *might* be the  
same problem I encountered at the Hackerspace in Tunis.  When using  
the AP of the gateway node the client can access the internet and when  
on another mesh node (say via ssh) you can access the internet,  
however, when you are on the AP of another node you cannot access the  
internet.

I had sent this to the tech list about two weeks ago, and in the  
office Seamus and Griffin thought it might be a zone issue.  Seamus  
and Griffin did you discover what the problem actually was?  Were you  
able to replicate the problem?

Best,
Ryan

"A MANET of a thousand nodes could support an entire battalion without
the need for manual network setup, management and maintenance that comes
from 'switchboard'-era communications," said Mark Rich, DARPA Program
Manager. "This could provide more troops with robust services such as
real-time video imagery, enhanced situational awareness and other
services that we have not yet imagined."

Yikes...leave it to DARPA to give good technologies a bad rap.

Finally! We've found mesh's "killer app!"

Exercise for this thread: mad-libs that paragraph to show that mesh is
for anyone.

"A MANET of a thousand nodes could support an entire <noun>______ without
the need for manual network setup, management and maintenance that comes
from 'switchboard'-era communications," said <name>____,
<acronym-you-define>_____ Program
Manager. "This could provide more <noun>____ with robust services such as
<adjective>____ <tech noun>_______, <adjective>______ <social
jargony-noun> ______ and other
services that we have not yet imagined."

My take:

"A MANET of a thousand nodes could support an entire festival without
the need for manual network setup, management and maintenance that comes
from 'switchboard'-era communications," said Davey Gravey, SPUN
(Smooth Percussive Universal Network) Program
Manager. "This could provide more music fans with robust services such as
distributed soundboard-processing, disruptive personal brand
advertising and other
services that we have not yet imagined."

a) Test of one WAP based on 1 picostation.

-home server based on WAMP connected to LAN port of picostation.
I can access to the web pages from my  Iphone .
-Internet service connected to the LAN port of Picostation .
I can access Internet from my Iphone.
-I can connect my Iphone to a laptop(windows) through  the AP.

b) Test of  one ESS based on 2  WAP (2 Picostations).
I have set the two picostations separately with Quick setup.

First question:
1)When I check the available wirelelss connections by my Laptop or Iphone 
I  see  :
-CommotionWifi (free).
-.Commotionwireless.net(with ad-hoc icon).If I try to connect with Iphone or 
Laptop a  password is required.Which password?
The network password I set in the administration page  doesn't work.

Second question.
-Some guidelines to set the two APs in bridge/range extension 
configuration(WDS..??).

Third
-Some guidelines to test the routers as ad-hoc network nodes.

Thanks.

I don't speak German, but I got a quick translation from someone who
does (thanks, Patrick!). It's a really great video...it would be neat to
have something similar for Commotion.

Hi Luigi,

I suspect you cannot connect your iphone to windows laptop because of 
the firewall on your windows laptop. Try disabling the windows firewall 
and see if you can connect after that.

For passwords, both the AP password and the network (ad-hoc) password 
should have been set during the quickstart wizard. You can check the AP 
password in /etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartSec and the ad-hoc 
password in /etc/commotion/profiles.d/quickstartMesh. You should only 
need the AP password when connecting with the iphone or laptop.

I don't have experience with WDS, so I'm sorry I can't help you there. 
This might help: http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/clientmode

What do you want to test regarding ad-hoc? The routers should be able 
to talk to each other over ad-hoc, so you can try pinging one from the 
other, using their 5.X.X.X IP addresses.

Hope this helps.

-Dan

I don't speak German either, but it seems really great! Also, I think
that's Commotion's same PINK!! :)

I feel like some of the sozi presentations that are on sparkleshare are
pretty close to this and might just need audio over them. Is that something
that we could do easily and publish?

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion Merch!
Message-ID: <519AA87F.9070004@opentechinstitute.org>

So with the release of Commotion DR1 stable close at hand, we should
think about getting some goodies to help promote the project. Stuff
like...stickers, buttons, and t-shirts! Clich?, right? Well, my idea for
Commotion fanny packs got shot down, so whatever.

I got recommendations from some folks for places to order merch for cheap:

* Stickers: PsPrint (http://www.psprint.com/)
* Buttons: Novelty buttons (http://www.noveltybuttons.com/ ... no
really, they are legit. And I can pick them up in Baltimore.)
* T-shirts: So I know some folks, in Baltimore, that have a really nice
screen print setup, and print for local businesses. Why get T-shirts
printed by some faceless corporation, when you can just get blank
t-shirts from a faceless corporation and get them printed by your
friends? Right?

Also, unless we want our t-shirts to end up as pajama-wear (like your "I
ran in <company name>'s 2008 5k marathon!" t-shirt you got for free and
wouldn't dare wear in public), maybe we could give em snazzy designs
instead of just a boring old logo. I'm thinking of something like the
Allied Media Conference's t-shirts: https://store.alliedmedia.org/.

What do yall think?

Hi Luigi,

Someone forwarded your question to the commotion-dev list, and some 
folks have responded: 
https://lists.chambana.net/pipermail/commotion-dev/2013-May/001397.html

I'd recommend signing up for that list if you haven't yet, as it is 
where we discuss the more technical aspects of Commotion.

cheers,
Dan

Hi Dan,
I was already registered on the olsrd list and I have forwarded my email 
also to them.
To be honest their answer was to contact you (Commotion).

I think that my problem can be checked easily from you.

More info about my problem.
The Ubuntu is  rel.13.04.

This is what I had done.
After to run olsrd I tried  to connect my laptop to the Picostation  using 
the mesh network commotionwireless.net.

The signal is very good but no connectivity exists .

I tried with the ping command from my laptop but the IP address 5.10..... of 
the picostation is not recognized:unkown IP address.

Therfore one of the possible reason of this,I guess, could be the error I 
have got after thr olsr installation.
I have reported it to you in the previous email.

On the other side if I use the picostation as AP and the laptop as client 
everything is working.Also the WDS.
Also if I look at the two Picosatation as mesh nodes(see the picture) 
everything works.


To summarize:
How can I make to work my 2 picostation and the linux laptop as  part of 
meshed netowork ?

I know that I'm not very precise and accurate, but if I have to do some 
trials in order you can understand better what i'm doing, let me know.

Luigi

Hi Luigi,

Someone forwarded your question to the commotion-dev list, and some
folks have responded:
https://lists.chambana.net/pipermail/commotion-dev/2013-May/001397.html

I'd recommend signing up for that list if you haven't yet, as it is
where we discuss the more technical aspects of Commotion.

cheers,
Dan

Well, living in a place of great distances, it could ease the start up
cost to use cheap existing stuff as relays, and replacing them one by
one by more potent things when the opportunity occurs (as I would prefer
to offer some mean of connection to the lonely traveller)

> Keep us posted on your progress.

I got myself a Picostation, Nanostation and a Bullet. So far I've 
played with the Pico and Nano and will put the Bullet into play tonight 
hopefully (as I finally found my antenna). Besides this I'll see what I 
can do with other OpenWRT capable hardware, like the WRT54GL, WR703N, 
DIR-300 etc, that seem to be pretty common and/or cheap hardware. 
Somehow we haven't found a good use for them yet in the hackerspace :)

There was really minimal configuration, which I'm happy about, for 
setting up the mesh nodes and they found each other immediately. However 
I did have some minor trouble setting up an internet connection (maybe 
future UIs can collect all necessary WAN setup on a single page? or 
perhaps I didn't rtfm enough!) but in the end  my neighbours (50+m away, 
through a couple of walls) being able to surf on my connection with 
relatively good speed.

Next step is perhaps to learn how to build my own images so those 
foreign ssh keys aren't there by default ;)

I'm definitely interested in trying out Commotion on various OpenWRT 
capable hardware and as I understand it, work is being made to package 
commotion to work better as a repository style installation with opkg 
etc.

I'm running GNU/Linux on all my desktop enabled machines, so I'll 
definitely try the Linux client out. I'll scout the sources and also 
have a look at the desktop environment applet stuff (I'm subscribed to 
the dev-list as well).

Thanks for making my experience with using Commotion positive so far! I 
was afraid I'd have to get dirt under my nails just to get it up and 
running to try it out, but this was exceptionally easy.

Hi folks,

Since yesterday, I'm watching this website and wondering where is the
difference with Commotion

https://github.com/WachterJud/qaul.net

Apparently, Qaul.net "implements a redundant, open communication principle,
in which wireless-enabled computers and mobile devices can directly form a
spontaneous network. Text messaging, file sharing and voice calls are
possible independent of internet and cellular networks. Qaul.net can spread
like a virus, and an Open Source Community can modify it freely.

Anyone here knows about this project, have worked with them?

Regards.

Fran?ois

Oops. I replied on the wrong list.

That project is new to me.

Based on only a cursory look through the repos, it seems like a
cross-platform port of OLSRd with some front end work and maybe a voip
client.

That would make it similar in scope to the PR3 commotion release, but
with a focus on platforms and language (qual) instead of local
applications and security (commotion).

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Community Wireless caucus at the Allied Media
	Conference
Message-ID: <513A0438.40304@opentechinstitute.org>

Hi all - I wanted to start the conversation around bringing people
together at this year's Allied Media Conference. For those folks that
aren't familiar with the conference, its an excellent place to come
together with a lot of other individuals and organizations and discuss
organizing strategies for our projects and movements. If you want to
read more, check out the conference web site:
http://amc.alliedmedia.org/

Put it on your calendars! June 20th to 23rd.

The idea is to come together and discuss building and running Community
Wireless networks. What is working for folks, and what are the
challenges? How do we raise funds, or what is the business model in use
for keeping our networks sustainable?

I'm going to reach out directly to folks I have been in touch with over
the past year or so, but I certainly don't know or have contacts with
all of the community networks in the country (or world!). Please pass
this notice around and invite people to the AMC so we can have a larger
and more productive conversation.

You can read the text of what I proposed below, at the bottom of this
email. Obviously this is just a proposal to the AMC, I'm hoping that it
will be approved so we can have the space at the conference.

Just so you all know, there are a number of other wireless and community
technology sessions being proposed this year at the AMC. Please consider
submitting your own proposal if you would like to share your stories and
strategies around your projects:
http://talk.alliedmedia.org/amc2013/tpsngs

Let me know if y'all have thoughts, questions or concerns about this!
-Andy


----
Community Wireless Networks Caucus

Neighborhoods and communities all over the world are opting to build
their own communications infrastructure, rather than wait for the big
Telco companies to do it for them in an affordable way. This dinnertime
caucus meeting brings together those organizations and individuals that
are starting to walk down that path, or have established networks
already. The goal is to share successes, pitfalls, and strategies for
connecting our communities and owning our own infrastructure.
Participants will walk away with connections, strategies and stories to
share with their collaborators!

The discussion is intended to cover:
* Community organizing strategies
* Planning and designing for your neighborhood
* Technical considerations and costs
* Fundraising, business models, and sustainability
* Success stories, such as:
  * What can we learn from WISPs? (Wireless Internet Service Providers)
  * Existing networks and the stories of their growth

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion Developer Release 01 is ready for
	download and testing
Message-ID: <51410CD8.6060101@opentechinstitute.org>

Commotion's first developer release (DR1) is now available for testing. 
This version replaces our September 2012 pre-release (PR3) and adds 
several new features. Though Commotion developers tested each component 
feature, we will begin extensive pre-release testing of the entire DR1 
suite in the coming weeks. We hope you will join us in testing the new 
components.

Pre-built Commotion packages for Ubiquiti routers and Android devices 
can be found at https://commotionwireless.net/download, with DR1 listed 
under Nightly Builds and PR3 listed as Stable. The download page also 
provides links to the Commotion source code for those who wish to build 
their own packages. We have pre-built images for testing on Ubiquiti 
wireless hardware. The source code includes instructions for building 
Commotion?s test release on other hardware for those that wish to test 
on their own devices.

The DR1 release brings a complete overhaul to the Commotion system while 
still ensuring compatibility with PR3 release Commotion nodes. 
Forward-facing features include a new theme, easy "quickstart" node 
configuration, application announcement and discovery, and a one-click 
troubleshooting tool. Behind the scenes, DR1 contains a core Commotion 
daemon and new cryptographic system.

The quickstart tool provides an easy interface for node configuration. 
The Commotion daemon provides a common mesh network management interface 
through an embedded library, and forms the core of future Commotion 
platform development. Commotion's new application suite uses mDNS to 
announce local applications across the network. Users can find local 
applications using the router?s web-based application portal. Node 
owners can easily manage and customize application portals for better 
community application support. The application portal integrates the 
Serval Project's key management daemon, which provides transparent 
message encryption and authentication. Finally, the debugging helper 
creates custom, downloadable documents for offline debugging by network 
administrators.

Each of these tools still requires thorough testing to ensure they are 
both stable and well documented. If you are an interested user, 
developer, hacker, or are just plain interested, we would love to hear 
your feedback. Following initial internal testing, DR1 will undergo lab 
testing on an eight-node physical test environment. Then we will install 
on the Open Technology Institute?s (OTI's) 18-node testbed community 
network. Once the software is deemed stable, we will deploy it on an 
active six-node community wireless network for user testing.

We will update the documentation to incorporate user feedback once 
testing is completed. After the build has been thoroughly tested and DR1 
has become stable, we will update the warning label on the downloads 
page to reflect the capabilities and limitations of this release. We 
will then bring the other Commotion platforms up to feature parity with 
the DR1 Commotion OpenWRT release.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] Commotion video?
Message-ID: <5149DBB2.1040300@opentechinstitute.org>

I just saw this great video Village Telco made for their Mesh Potato
router: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S30M_nigtcs. I think it would be
great to have something along those lines about Commotion and the
capabilities Commotion provides. We've received some feedback on our
website lately from people suggesting we make a video explaining
Commotion. It would be a great way to get a consistent message out there

Hey David,

I know some of our Commotion staffers who work closely with the training 
material are going to respond to this as well, but I wanted to shoot out 
a link to some of our early work with gamifying mesh network planning to 
give you an idea of some of the work we have done.

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] International Summit for Community Wireless
	Networks 2013
Message-ID: <514CA0AD.8080201@opentechinstitute.org>

Are you passionate about using technology to improve your community? Do
you want to help expand access to affordable Internet? Are you an
advocate for open technology, ICT4D or community-owned infrastructure?

If so, then we invite to you to participate in this year's International
Summit for Community Wireless Networks (IS4CWN)
<http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/>. The Summit will take place in
Berlin on October 2-4, 2013.

IS4CWN is a gathering of technology experts, policy analysts,
on-the-ground specialists, and researchers working on state-of-the-art
community broadband projects across the globe. Above all, IS4CWN is a
community of communities, and the annual summit serves as an opportunity
to share ideas and challenges, discuss policy issues, and coordinate
research and development efforts.

The 2013 Summit theme is community. In the past decade -- which included
the founding of Freifunk <http://start.freifunk.net/>, the birth of the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks, and the genesis of
major projects including Commotion <https://commotionwireless.net/> and
CONFINE <http://confine-project.eu/> -- the community wireless movement
has expanded substantially in both size and visibility.

But where do we go from here? How can we take the movement to the next
level in terms of technological advancement, community engagement, and
diversity? We encourage our speakers, workshop leaders, and participants
to think big this year and help us grow our community of communities.

Interested? Head on over to www.WirelessSummit.org
<http://www.wirelesssummit.org/>.
Registration is open and forms to submit workshop proposals and
request travel funding are available. Early registrants will receive a
50% discount.

Potential topics include: using wireless for social justice, rural
broadband frameworks, technical developments in mesh networking,
spectrum policy, training communities in technical skills, case studies
of networks, challenges of corporate monopolies, and much more.

This year's Summit is committed to having a diversity of voices and
experience, and we're looking to have a lot of new faces in the room.
Community networks encompass a whole range of social, political and
technical challenges, so technical knowledge is definitely not required.

Access to technology and technical knowledge has been historically
inequitable and remains so to this day. Recognizing this, the
International Summit for Community Wireless Networks aspires to include
participants and speakers from a broad range of backgrounds and
experiences. We seek and welcome diversity in order to reflect the
communities that wireless networks can and should serve, cultivating
expertise, creativity, and innovation. Please join us in creating an
environment of respect, equity, and accessibility at all levels of
Summit involvement.

Hi Laurence,

Great to hear you're interested in the project, and thanks for your
thoughtful questions. I'll answer them as best I can for now. Responses
inline.

The concept behind Commotion is to make the barrier to entry into a
local mesh network as low as possible while leveraging the inherent
benefits of mesh networks.

Most existing mesh network platforms require a significant amount of
networking knowledge of users and deployers. A mesh device running
Commotion will require the minimum amount of configuration from the
user. The pre-release of Commotion basically reduces this configuration
to selecting the name of a mesh network to start or join.

No mesh platforms include a set of commonly-used services or services
that are suited to take advantage of the unique characteristics of mesh
networks. Commotion will include anonymization, encryption, and
communication services by default. Commotion distributions for end user
devices will also include a services browser. This tool will display
local services that have been deployed on the mesh network like video,
chat, streaming radio, and any other services that communities choose to
deploy on their networks.

Existing mesh platforms target a very narrow set of hardware, severely
limiting deployment. Commotion already targets the most common wifi
hardware, but will also be available for as many consumer wifi devices
as possible. Commotion will target consumer- and professional-grade
wireless routers, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and mobile phones. The goal
is to increase the quality of the infrastructure by encouraging users to
deploy Commotion on as many devices as possible.

A mesh network does not include Internet access by default. At least one
mesh node must be connected to the Internet to provide Internet access
to other nodes within the mesh. The quality of that Internet access
would then, of course, be dependent on the quality of the link of that
single node, or "backhaul". But since wireless links between nodes are
inherently lossy, the quality of the Internet connection for any node
within the network would also depend on the number of links, or "hops",
between it and the backhaul node. It would also depend on the quality of
those hops.

But a mesh network can also utilize multiple backhauls. The more
backhauls that users can incorporate into the mesh, the more robust
Internet access will be. More backhauls - even low-quality backhauls -
will at the very least decrease the number of hops for some nodes in a mesh.

That said, developing a very basic non-techy table of number of
backhauls vs backhaul quality vs number of hops would certainly be
helpful, and we will attempt to incorporate this into our non-technical
documents as we go forward.

One of the primary benefits of a mesh network is its unique capacity to
distribute local services to mesh participants without Internet
backhauls. For example, in my hometown we have a low-power FM radio
station whose range has been severely limited by the geography of the
area. Once my community deploys mesh nodes, we can start a very simple
network service at the station that will stream the audio from the
soundboard out to any user on the mesh, effectively extending the range
of the radio station without any Internet access.

Rural areas are egregiously underserved by commercial Internet service
providers, but a mesh network reduces the need for Internet service in
the first place. By encouraging hyper-local services and communication,
communities can reduce their dependence on commercial Internet service
providers.

Further, mesh networks can be connected to other mesh networks very
easily. Mesh node radios within a village may be low-power or only use
low-gain antennas. But a high-power, directional radio could connect a
village mesh with any other village mesh within range. This would
connect multiple rural villages to each other the same way that
villagers are connected to each other by their local mesh. Local
services in one village could be extended to other villages.

Then, if one village acquired a sufficiently high-data-rate Internet
backhaul, that backhaul could be shared with other villages.

Great idea. I think these answers should go on our upcoming
non-technical site. Meanwhile, feel free to respond with your thoughts.

Yes, it was. Our apologies. We're working to upgrade access to the
Commotion source code. It's up now, and all public-facing functionality
has been restored.

Thanks!

Dear Admin,
 
I would like to add on to Laurence's request below, besides a non-technical user guide, is it possible to also include a technical user guide?
 
Points to include in the user guide could be
1) what to download and where
2) how to reverse engineering your router or mobile with commotion
3) what configuration is required
4) how to create a mesh network after having a couple of commotion-enabled UE devices
and on to other more advanced topics, but that could just be a start
 
I also like to point out that there are problems with the user login feature on the website, or is that not required afterall?
 
Hope that this does not come across as a demand but rather a suggestion, I love the idea and will work towards creating a mesh network for seniors to save on mobility costs.
 
Thank you,
Vincent

In Urbana, IL we are documenting on our wiki as we work with commotion,
which may be a starting point for you. They are very incomplete right now,
but do provide an overview of where/how to download pre-built images, and
how to flash Ubiquity and Fonera routers.

I'm planning to write up some instructions for this soon. But building an
image with commotion is pretty simple thanks to the included setup script.
I'll post more when that's completed, but basically you customize a config
file, and potentially some other files that define your network, and then
run the included setup.sh script. It will check out the latest openwrt code
through svn, then add in the commotion configs, your custom configs, and the
frontend web interface.

That is an excellent suggestion, and one that's been on our minds here
at OTI as well.

We're trying to cover so much ground that even our more advanced users
are likely to get stuck at some point. My goal is to be able to identify
the common sticking points and give some sort of suggestion even if a
full answer is not available.

My focus right now is on overhauling the project site. Some of the
things I plan to add are development task lists, how-to documents (such
as you've suggested below), and a more useful navigation scheme. We're
also splitting the "What is Commotion"-type material off onto a separate
site, which should help us organize the technical and non-technical
documentation a little more easily.

In the mean time, please keep sending questions and suggestions to the
list. I want to be sure all of this material makes it to the project site.

Very cool. I'm glad you've been working on it. It's much easier to move
stuff around than it is to generate from scratch.

Andrew- I'll definitely move/copy anything we generate to the project site.
We've basically just been using our wiki in the interim as we play with the
PR2 Debug release.

I also built a usable fonera image last night that I'll upload to the files
section.

Thanks for your work on this!

Subject: [Commotion-discuss] New here
Message-ID: <CAKcJoPn_0WLusGPBZKuJVw6U+RBTMt3H+2Z7xcH7LgCymZMsFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am really excited by this project.
I just read two reports on French press about it:
http://www.lemonde.fr/technologies/article/2011/08/30/commotion-le-projet-d-un-internet-hors-de-tout-controle_1565282_651865.html
http://www.lepoint.fr/high-tech-internet/internet-le-kit-anti-censure-progresse-aux-etats-unis-31-08-2011-1368421_47.php

A bit of presentation first.
I am a French computer engineer specialist of Linux and Internet
technology currently living in India.
It remained me of trying to install long distance wireless connection
between Geneva and Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2000-2001, at the time of
the Seattle Wireless debut.
I am impatient trying this in India, both to overcome connection
costs, and the attempt of censorship by the government.

Please keep in touch.

Best regards,

Yann
